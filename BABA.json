            "Text": "InvestorPlace\n\nAs a member of r/WallStreetBets, a popular Reddit forum, let me tell you this: It wasn’t supposed to ever happen. Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood.

Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350.

            "Text": "InvestorPlace\n\nAs a member of r/WallStreetBets, a popular Reddit forum, let me tell you this: It wasn’t supposed to ever happen. Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price.

            "Text": "China's economy has expanded at a torrid pace in recent decades to become the world's second largest, as measured by nominal GDP. China, the world's most populous nation, has long been a manufacturing and exporting powerhouse. But the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has slashed China's growth in the short term.

            "Headline": "Dow Jones Today, Stocks Open Higher On Stimulus Hopes; Small Caps, Chip Stocks Rally\t",
            "Text": "Stocks jumped Thursday, as investors looked past Wednesday's presidential impeachment and toward details of a $1.5 trillion stimulus spending proposal from President-elect Joe Biden. Tesla dragged at the bottom of the Nasdaq. Boeing, Intel and Johnson & Johnson hoisted the Dow Jones today. Airlines rallied following Delta Air Lines' Q4 report. A strong outlook from Taiwan Semiconductor helped rally chip stocks. And China-based stocks surged as the U.S. Treasury gave up an effort to ban U.S. investment in Alibaba and Tencent Holdings.\n\nX\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 165 points, opening up 0.45% on the stock market today. The Nasdaq jumped 0.3%, despite Tesla (TSLA) lagging at the bottom of the index. Tesla shares dropped 1.3% after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requested the company recall 158,000 model S and X vehicles, due to touchscreen malfunctions.\n\nThe S&P 500 added 0.2% in early action. Chip equipment makers KLA (KLAC) and Applied Materials (AMAT) led the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 in early trade. Chip equipment makers KLA and Applied Materials swung more than 7% higher. Shares received boosts from Taiwan Semiconductor's strong capital spending outlook, and possibly from improved prospects for major customer Intel, as the chip giant prepares for a transition in executive leadership.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) and InterContinental Exchange (ICE) weighted on the S&P 5400 in early action.\n\nStocks on Wednesday generally shrugged off the impeachment of outgoing President Donald Trump by the U.S. House Of Representatives. The Nasdaq rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 gained 0.2%, and the Dow industrials closed effectively flat. The Senate will not take up the matter of conviction until after Trump has exited the White House on Jan. 20. And, as noted in Wednesday's Big Picture, \"the market seems more focused on the next administration at this point,\" according to research from Commonwealth Financial Network.\n\nOn Thursday, President-elect Joe Biden is expected to outline plans for a $1.5 trillion stimulus package, news to which stocks are likely to pay attention.\n\nGear up for Thursday's market action by reading IBD's Investing Action Plan.\n\nWeekly Jobless Claims Jump, Again\n\nPremarket trade showed no real impact from unemployment data, which showed jobless claims bouncing for a second straight week. The Labor Department reported 965,000 Americans filed claims for first-time unemployment benefits in the week ended Jan. 9. That was a sharp jump above forecasts for 790,000 claims, and a full 23% above the prior week's 784,000 applications.\n\nContinuing claims came in at 5.27 million, above expectations for 5 million, as well as the prior week's 5.07 million claims.\n\nEarnings: Delta Air, Taiwan Semi Surge\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) rallied 3.8%, despite reporting a mixed fourth-quarter performance and providing weak guidance for the current quarter. But the company reported a 90% reduction in its cash burn during the quarter, and provided details on federal stimulus support.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) also delivered mixed fourth-quarter results. Management expected first-quarter results to be supported by \"HPC-related demand, recovery in the automotive segment, and a milder smartphone seasonality than in recent years.\"\n\nTSM shares vaulted 7.5% higher in opening trade. The IBD Leaderboard stock has so far gained more than 17% for January, and is extended above a three-weeks-tight buy point at 107.94. The company has a conference call scheduled for 1 p.m. ET.\n\nSmall Caps Set to Rally: GamepStop, Aphria Spike\n\nSmall caps rallied, as the Russell 2000 and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) each climbed a 1.2%. GameStop (GME) soared 8.6% in early trade, after spiking 57.4% on Wednesday. The shares have experienced a short squeeze, as short sellers exit the stock after GameStop said Tuesday that Chewy (CHWY) co-founder Ryan Cohen would join the retailer's board and that Cohen's RC Ventures fund had established a 10% stake in the company.\n\nCanada-based cannabis small cap Aphria (APHA) spiked 18% after reporting a steep fiscal second-quarter loss, but better-than-expected earnings.\n\nDow Jones Today: Intel Rakes In Upgrades, AMD Downgraded\n\nIntel (INTC) continued to climb, leading the Dow Jones today with a 3% advance. Intel stock jumped 7% Wednesday after the company announced Chief Executive Bob Swan would step down in February, and named VMware's (VMW) Pat Gelsinger to take the helm.\n\nBy Thursday, analysts were weighing in with at least five upgrades for Intel. BMO Capital and Cowen bestowed the most optimistic price targets, at 75 — almost 32% above Wednesday's closing price. The BMO Capital note projected Intel shares would \"begin to shake off the big discount\" to the S&P 500.\n\nThe BMO note also downgraded Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), an IBD Leaderboard stock, and trimmed its price target on the chipmaker to 75, from 80. The report credited AMD President and CEO Lisa Su with \"near flawless execution,\" but says part of AMD's valuation owed to Intel's weakness, and that Intel was now set to become a more competitive entity. AMD shares dropped a fraction in early trade.\n\nTransition Of Power\n\nWashington, D.C., is braced for the most embattled transition of U.S. presidential power in 160 years, with Biden due to be sworn in as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is warning of planned armed protests during the inauguration ceremony, and in all 50 state capitals.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray on Wednesday briefed local law enforcement across the country about the \"state of play,\" regarding those threats, and said the FBI was setting up new command posts nationwide, according to the Washington Post. The Hill reported that Capitol security officials warned lawmakers in Washington of four specific armed threats against the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court during a call late Monday night.\n\nThe Secret Service initiated a \"high-security alert\" status six days earlier than is normal due to threats of violent assault against Washington. The Secret Service coordinates inauguration security efforts across agencies including the FBI, National Guard and U.S. Marshals Service. The federal Capitol Police and Washington's Metropolitan Police Department are also central actors. The Pentagon raised the number of National Guard troops to be deployed to 20,000.\n\nChina Stocks: U.S. Abandons Effort To Block Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu\n\nAlibaba Group Holdings (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU) both jumped Thursday, after the Wall Street Journal reported Treasury Department officials ended the effort to prevent U.S. investment in the companies. The Pentagon reportedly led a move to block Alibaba and Tencent Holdings from receiving U.S. investor dollars, due to suspected links with China's military. Officials considered including Baidu, then rejected the idea.\n\nIn Hong Kong, Alibaba shares rose 3.9%, while Tencent gained nearly 5%, according to Bloomberg. In U.S. trade, Alibaba climbed 3.6%, topping IBD's Long-Term Leaders list. Baidu leapt 5.4% while Tencent climbed 3.7. Tencent shares traded just below an 81.45 buy point in a 10-week cup base.\n\nAmong other China-based stocks, Futu Holdings (FUTU) was 7.7% higher as the IBD 50 stock looks to extend its gain after a breakout above a 51.20 buy point. Shares are up well over 20% in less than two weeks, once again triggering the eight-week hold rule. Futu is a tough-to-hold hot potato, and there are some caveats in its hold rule. But the eight-week hold rule served investors well following the stock's prior breakout.\n\nMobile e-commerce platform provider Pinduoduo (PDD) rallied 1.6% in early action. If the move holds up through the starting bell, it would end a three-day slide and mark a healthy rebound from the stocks 21-day exponential moving average. Pinduoduo ended Wednesday 14% below what IBD MarketSmith analysis notes is an ascending base with a buy point at 187.80.\n\nGold, Copper Prices Steady\n\nCommodities were steady early Thursday, not pointing to any pronounced moves among investors in or out of safe haven.\n\nGold prices have been steady to lower over the past week. Like bonds, the dollar and now, to some degree, bitcoin, gold prices tend to rise in periods of uncertainty, as investors shelter capital in \"safe haven\" assets. Gold hits its highest price ever, above $2,067 an ounce in August, during uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic. Prices hit $1,954 an ounce on Jan. 5. Gold has since backed off about 6%, slipping 0.8% on Thursday to $1,839.\n\nStock Market ETF Strategy And How To Invest In The Current Uptrend\n\nCopper acts as an indicator of economic activity, on speculation for demand in construction and manufacturing sectors. Copper prices hit a high on Jan. 7 at around $3.69 a pound. Prices backed off a little more than 3%, then stabilized. On Thursday, copper prices firmed up 0.4% to around $3.63 a pound.\n\nOil Price Flat After Big Run\n\nOil prices also move according to economic outlooks: busier economies need more energy. But oil is also very sensitive to shifts in supply relative to demand within the industry. Miscalculations by producers in OPEC countries or in the U.S. shale industry can lead to significant price changes. Those price changes affect hundreds of influential stocks and funds. Those stocks and funds, in turn, can have a heavy impact on how the stock market behaves.\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\n\nOil prices have rebounded sharply over the past two months, after posting the steepest collapse in a century during the first four months of the year. The U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate oil, has recently hovered just above $52 a barrel, after rebounding almost 44% since early November. WTI on Wednesday rose briefly to its highest mark since late February, at nearly $54. Prices early Thursday were effectively flat, at just below $53 a barrel.\n\nBitcoin Rebounds Above $40,000\n\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin popped more than 15%, to above $40,000 in early trade Thursday, according to CoinDesk. The rebound moves the cryptocurrency closer to its Jan. 8 high above $41,500. Bitcoin has more than doubled since the start of December.\n\nAmong bitcoin-related stocks, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) rumbled 10.2% higher, aiming to add a third day to its rebound. Marathon Patent Group (MARA) vaulted 13.4%, while MicroStrategy (MSTR) rallied 14.4%.\n\nIBD Leaderboard stock PayPal Holdings (PYPL) jumped 1.7%. Pyapal stock is extended, up about 13% from a 215.93 buy point in a cup base.\n\nCoronavirus Update\n\nThe number of deaths from coronavirus cases have continued to hit new daily highs for the past week. The number of daily deaths held above 4,000 for a second day on Wednesday. That raised the seven-day average for deaths to 3,418 — up 125% since the start of December, according to data from Worldometer.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 vaccine doses distributed increased to 29.38 million on Wednesday, a 90% increase over the past week. The Centers for Disease Control reports 10.278 million of those doses have been administered, up 125% over the past seven days.\n\nDow Jones Today: J&J In Buy Range, Gets Vaccine Boost\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) rallied 1.4% after the New England Journal of Medicine published positive results from interim phase 1 and 2 tests of the company's coronavirus vaccine. The company said it would have phase 3 test results for its coronavirus vaccine later this month.\n\nJ&J stock remained in a buy range, above what IBD MarketSmith analysis charts as a 157.10 buy point in a 35-week flat base. The buy zone runs to 164.96. J&J pays an annual dividend of $3.80, yielding 2.4%.\n\nFind Alan R.

However, JD stock dipped 1.3% to 89.24.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has maintained a confrontational stance on China, using a combination of sanctions, tariffs, executive orders and blacklists in hopes of winning concessions on a variety of issues, including trade and national security.\n\nBut Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has taken a more dovish stance on China, pushed back, stopping the plan. Mnuchin reportedly believed including Alibaba stock and other major companies would destabilize markets and create economic fallout.\n\nAlibaba and Tencent count as China's two most valuable publicly traded companies, with a combined market valuation of $1.3 trillion. Widely held by U.S. and global investors, the stocks weigh heavily on indexes. Alibaba stock, however is below its record high and trades below its 50-day moving average.\n\nTo find the best stocks to buy or watch, check out IBD Stock Lists and other IBD research.\n\nPlease follow Brian Deagon on Twitter at @IBD_BDeagon for more on tech stocks, analysis and financial markets.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nIs Alibaba Stock A Buy?\n\nAlibaba Stock Drops As China Regulators Tighten Internet Scrutiny\n\nAlibaba Stock Drops On Suspension Of IPO\n\nMake Investing Simpler And Profit From Leaderboard\n\nProfit From Short-Term In A Swing Trading Environment"

            "Headline": "Trump Impeachment, Biden's $2 Trillion Plan, Alibaba, Delta - 5 Things You Must Know Thursday",
            "Text": "President-elect Joe Biden reportedly could unveil a Covid-19 relief package of about $2 trillion; President Trump is impeached a second time; U.S. investors can still buy shares of Alibaba and Baidu.\n\nHere are five things you must know for Thursday, Jan. 14:\n\n1. -- Stock Futures Rise Ahead of Biden's Spending Proposal\n\nStock futures traded mostly higher Thursday and Treasury yields rose after a report said President-elect Joe Biden could unveil a Covid-19 relief package of about $2 trillion.\n\nContracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 78 points, S&P 500 futures gained 4 points and Nasdaq futures fell 3 points.\n\nBiden's advisers recently told allies in Congress to expect a price tag of about $2 trillion, CNN reported, citing two people briefed on the deliberations.\n\nBiden is expected to announce his plans for coronavirus relief on Thursday evening.\n\nThe Biden team is taking a \"shoot for the moon\" approach with the package, one lawmaker told CNN. The proposal is expected to include sizable direct payments to American families, and significant state and local funding, including for coronavirus vaccine distribution, according to the report.\n\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 1.107% following the CNN report. Yields have been rising recently on expectations the incoming Biden administration would boost government spending.\n\nStocks finished mixed Wednesday, shortly before the House voted to impeach President Donald Trump.\n\n2. -- Donald Trump Impeached a Second Time\n\nPresident Donald Trump was impeached Wednesday by the House of Representatives for inciting insurrection.\n\nIt was the second time Trump has been impeached during his administration, and comes just a week before he is to leave office.\n\nThe House voted 232 to 197 to impeach Trump. Ten Republican members joined Democrats in voting to impeach the president.\n\nIt remains unclear when the Senate will conduct a trial, though outgoing Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republican colleagues in a letter Wednesday it won’t get underway until Trump's term ends on Jan. 20 and Joe Biden takes office.\n\nMcConnell, however, said he hasn't decided on whether to convict Trump for inciting an insurrection that left five dead after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol to disrupt the ceremonial counting of Electoral College Votes confirming Biden’s victory in November.\n\nIn his letter, McConnell wrote that \"while the press has been full of speculation, I have not made a final decision on how I will vote and I intend to listen to the legal arguments when they are presented to the Senate.\"\n\n3. -- Thursday's Economic Calendar: Jobless Claims, Jerome Powell Discussion\n\nThe U.S. economic calendar for Thursday includes weekly Jobless Claims at 8:30 a.m. ET and Import and Export Prices for December at 8:30 a.m.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will appear at a livestream event hosted by Markus Brunnermerier, director of Princeton University's Bendheim Center for Finance, at 12:30 p.m.\n\nBlackRock (BLK) - Get Report posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $10.18 a share share, beating analysts' estimates of $9.14. Assets under management at BlackRock rose to a record $8.68 trillion in the fourth quarter.\n\nDelta Air Lines (DAL) - Get Report reported an adjusted fourth-quarter loss of $2.53 a share vs. analysts' expectations that called for a loss of $2.51.\n\nThe stock rose more than 2% in premarket trading.\n\nHow to Trade Delta Air Lines After Earnings Report\n\n4. -- U.S. Investors Still Allowed to Buy Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu Shares\n\nThe U.S. government is expected to let American investors continue to buy shares of Chinese technology giants Alibaba Group (BABA) - Get Report, Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) and Baidu (BIDU) - Get Report, The Wall Street Journal reported, after weighing the companies’ alleged ties to China’s military against the potential economic impact of banning them.\n\nThe three Chinese tech giants were on a list of about a dozen companies being examined by the Defense Department as supporting China’s military, intelligence and security services, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. U.S. investors have until November to divest their holdings of any company on the list.\n\nThe decision to not add Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu - which have about $1.4 trillion in combined market capitalization - to the list pitted Treasury officials, who feared widespread selloffs and economic fallout, against State Department and Pentagon officials seeking a tougher line against Beijing, the Journal noted.\n\nNine other companies will be added to the list as well as more than 100 subsidiaries of companies already on the list.\n\nAmerican depositary receipts of Alibaba rose 2.8% in premarket trading to $241.90, and Baidu gained 2.25% to $242.27.\n\n5. -- J&J Says One-Shot Covid Vaccine Generates Immune Response\n\nJohnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) - Get Report single-shot coronavirus vaccine candidate has been shown to be safe and to generate a meaningful immune response in an early phase trial.\n\nA single shot of the vaccine “gives sustainable antibodies,” Dr. Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer at J&J, told CNBC. The results give the company “confidence” that the vaccine will be effective, he added.\n\nThe results of the phase 1-2 trials were published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nJohnson & Johnson’s vaccine candidate is undergoing phase 3 trials as well to determine its actual effectiveness. Results from that study are expected later this month.\n\nIf successful and approved, the J&J vaccine would become the third available to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 385,000 Americans and almost 2 million globally.\n\nJohnson & Johnson shares rose 1.58% to $160.38 in premarket trading."

            "Text": "InvestorPlace\n\nAs a member of r/WallStreetBets, a popular Reddit forum, let me tell you this: It wasn’t supposed to ever happen. Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared?

So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

            "Text": "In this article we will list 15 cheapest online shopping sites in US. Please continue to see 5 cheapest online shopping sites in US. Shopping is an activity that relaxes people and relieves accumulated stress. It is a phenomenal type of relaxation and it is a salvation from many obligations. Since it relieves the brain because it distracts it from everyday problems, shopping is the right thing to do for all those who want to relax looking at their potentially new favorite clothes for example. People often think that owning a large number of things means a better life. Plus, shopping makes people happy. In one study, scientists observed reactions in the subjects' brains while thinking about buying things. When images of the products they wanted were displayed, a part of the brain called the nucleus was activated which means that the respondents were satisfied with the very sight of the thing.\n\nActually, the brain then triggers the secretion of the hormone dopamine, because of which we feel comfortable and happy. It is enough to think about something we want to buy to feel better instantly. \"If you feel good in your skin, material goods are more likely to make you happy. Otherwise, that gap is difficult to fill.\" Many economists believe that our impulse to own things is in human nature. That could also fit into the theory of evolution. Since resources on Earth are limited, people who grab more things for themselves will have an advantage over everyone else. With the internet, you do not need to always go to a shop to buy what you need. You can easily do that in the comfort of your home. Also, buying is now easier than before with this method of shopping. You can shop from anywhere in the world with online shopping. There are a lot of online stores and discount shopping sites available for you, especially in the USA. Time savings, easy comparison of prices, products and assortment and reviews of other consumers are some of the advantages of online search. We can conclude that consumers are increasingly informed and use technological advantages to make the smartest possible purchase.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forever changed online shopping behaviors, according to a survey of about 3,700 consumers in nine emerging and developed economies. The survey, entitled “COVID-19 and E-commerce”, examined how the pandemic has changed the way consumers use e-commerce and digital solutions. It covered Brazil, China, Germany, Italy, the Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland and Turkey. Following the pandemic, more than half of the survey’s respondents now shop online more frequently and rely on the internet more for news, health-related information and digital entertainment. Consumers in emerging economies have made the greatest shift to online shopping, the survey shows.\n\nThe survey conducted by UNCTAD and NetCom Suisse eCommerce Association, in collaboration with the Brazilian Network Information Center and Inveon, shows that online purchases have increased by 6 to 10 percentage points across most product categories. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift towards a more digital world. However, average online monthly spending per shopper has dropped. Consumers in both emerging and developed economies have postponed larger expenditures, with those in emerging economies focusing more on essential products. Tourism and travel sectors have suffered the strongest decline, with average spending per online shopper dropping by 75%. The pandemic has brought changes in the world of online shopping, but people are now more friendly oriented to digitalization. Here you can see 10 best selling products online in 2020.\n\nWe came to our list by comparing many lists on the Internet, for example on bestchineseproducts.com, chinabrands.com, ecomelites.com, people voting on different blogs, and choosing the 15 most represented.

Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans.

Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood.

            "Headline": "Tencent super app WeChat celebrates a decade of influence in China's online world, but are its best years behind?",
            "Text": "Chen Channing, a 30-year-old legal professional in Shenzhen, cannot go a day without WeChat, the all purpose app developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings.\n\nBefore he brushes his teeth in the morning, Chen checks for messages on the app. He uses the payment function to ride the subway to work and on the way reads the WeChat news digest. At the office, Chen spends most of his working day using the desktop version of the app.\n\nIn his leisure time, Chen shares pictures and music with friends using the mobile version and when he is hungry, meals are ordered and paid for on WeChat too. \"WeChat has become part of every aspect of my life and work,\" Chen said. \"I cannot live without it.\"\n\nGet the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.\n\nIt is the same story for many of the 1.09 billion people who use the app every day - predominantly mainland Chinese - who have come to depend on WeChat for their daily life.\n\nWeChat users spend an average of 77 minutes a day on the app, which effectively provides the equivalent of WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, Facebook and PayPal on one platform, a study shows. Photo: Shutterstock alt=WeChat users spend an average of 77 minutes a day on the app, which effectively provides the equivalent of WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, Facebook and PayPal on one platform, a study shows. Photo: Shutterstock\n\nA study by data provider China Internet Watch found that WeChat users spend an average of 77 minutes a day on the app, which effectively provides the equivalent of WhatsApp, Instagram, Google, Facebook and PayPal on one platform.\n\nWeChat also accounted for one fifth, or 21.5 per cent, of total user time on the mobile internet as of September 2020, according to QuestMobile.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to say that WeChat has profoundly changed how Chinese people interact with each other and with the online world.\n\nThe success of the super app, which turns 10 this week, has also helped make Tencent Holdings the largest company in Asia and propelled its market capitalisation to US$800 billion, the sixth biggest globally - up from US$47 billion a decade ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is also the second biggest stock on the Hang Seng Index, with a 10.09 per cent weighting, ahead of banking giant HSBC and behind only AIA.\n\n\"WeChat is definitely the most successful internet product in China in the past decade ...[it achieved a] miracle to grow from zero to 1.2 billion in that period of time,\" said Zhang Dingding, an internet industry commentator and former head of Beijing-based research firm Sootoo Institute, ­referring to earlier estimates of user numbers.\n\n\"The value of WeChat is beyond numbers. It has helped us connect to each other ... and offered a wide range of services that changed all walks of life,\" Zhang said.\n\nMany factors have contributed to its success, including China's Great Firewall, which blocks foreign social media like WhatsApp, Instagram, Google and Facebook.\n\nWeChat was also in the right place at the right time, riding the explosion in smartphone usage in China over the past decade.\n\nWeChat was in the right place at the right time, riding the explosion in smartphone usage in China over the past decade. Photo: SCMP Pictures alt=WeChat was in the right place at the right time, riding the explosion in smartphone usage in China over the past decade. Photo: SCMP Pictures\n\nThen there was the initial design of the app - simple and fun to use, thanks to its chief architect Allen Zhang Xiaolong, who has been one of the highest paid executives in China since 2016.\n\nHowever, there are dark clouds hanging over WeChat's tenth anniversary.\n\nTencent's censorship of content on the app is becoming notorious - both at home and abroad - and accounts deemed to promote \"inappropriate or illegal\" content - which can include violence, pornography and gambling but also political speech - are quickly shut down.\n\nThe University of Toronto's Citizen Lab has charged that WeChat is a tool used by the Chinese government to maintain surveillance on its citizens and to manipulate public opinion in its favour.\n\nOutgoing US president Donald Trump previously issued executive orders banning US businesses from having any dealings with WeChat, citing security concerns.\n\nWhile WeChat does not have to worry about foreign competition, it is facing a fierce fight from emerging domestic rivals like ByteDance with its hugely popular Douyin short video app, which had 600 million daily active users as of August last year.\n\nChinese people are spending six more hours per month on mobile phones compared with a year ago, according to a QuestMobile report in October, but the additional time was devoted to video apps like Douyin and Tencent-backed Kuaishou.\n\nWeChat - along with Baidu's search engine and iQiyi and Alibaba Group Holding's Taobao, Tmall and Alipay - saw flat or even negative growth in share of screen time. (Alibaba owns the Post).\n\nIn an effort to fend off the short video challengers, WeChat has been pushing its own version, Channels, launched a year ago. Zhang, the \"father\" of WeChat, said in July last year that the feature had accumulated 200 million users at the end of June, but WeChat has not provided any update of user numbers since.\n\nZhang said at the annual \"open class\" on Tuesday evening that the future of WeChat will be tied to video.\n\nOutgoing US president Donald Trump has issued executive orders banning US businesses from having any dealings with WeChat, citing security concerns.

Photo: AFP\n\n\"Video expression will be a major theme for the next 10 years of content generation,\" he told the audience.\n\n\"[Channels] is growing strong, largely due to the fact that its advantage is that it is already in the WeChat ecosystem,\" said Mark Tanner, managing director of Shanghai-based consultancy China Skinny. \"But it doesn't appear as sticky or addictive as Douyin in particular, as Douyin continues to erode its share of screen time.\"\n\nCriticism over Tencent's apparent monopolistic business practises is also becoming louder.\n\nXie Xin, the ByteDance vice-president overseeing its collaboration and communication app Feishu, known as Lark in overseas markets, said WeChat has blocked the service.\n\nSuch complaints have become common lately but Tencent said in a recent announcement that it has acted fairly in blocking external links that violate its rules, including those of Tencent-backed products.\n\nWeChat sprang from the Tencent Guangzhou Research and Project centre in January 2011. Zhang, head of Tencent's QQ Mail Mobile at the time, led a small team that developed the first version of WeChat in less than 70 days, beating two other internal teams trying to achieve the same goal.\n\nThe initial version of WeChat only allowed users to send text messages and photos. The inflection point for the WeChat team arrived in May 2011 when it was updated with voice messaging, enabling a user's phone to work like a walkie-talkie.\n\nAllen Zhang headed the team that created WeChat. Photo: Handout alt=Allen Zhang headed the team that created WeChat. Photo: Handout\n\nAfter a decade of optimisation, the app is still growing. Tencent has built up a huge ecosystem around WeChat with so-called mini programs, which are apps typically smaller than 10 megabytes that can run instantly on the main app's interface.\n\nThis design has enabled WeChat to become a ubiquitous platform. The number of daily active users of WeChat mini apps has reached 400 million, according to data released at the WeChat conference on Tuesday. Monthly active users for mini games alone surpassed 500 million in 2020.\n\nDespite the ubiquity of WeChat among Chinese around the world, Tencent has yet to seriously begin monetising the app. Of Tencent's total revenue, 56 per cent is derived from \"value-added services\" - essentially game related income - while 27 per cent is from fintech and 17 per cent from online advertising.\n\n\"WeChat's biggest opportunity is its established user base and ecosystem, which it can continue to strengthen if it's prepared to incorporate more artificial intelligence and build a more intuitive, entertaining and less clunky user interface,\" said Tanner, referring to how the original simplicity of the program has become complicated by so many functions.\n\nWeChat - along with Baidu's search engine and iQiyi and Alibaba Group Holding's Taobao, Tmall and Alipay - saw flat or even negative growth in share of screen time.

Photo: Bloomberg\n\n\"The under-tapped lower-tier and rural consumers also present further opportunity to acquire more usage and users,\" he said.\n\nBut one thing is certain: WeChat faces a more challenging future with tighter regulation, stiffer competition and changes in consumer habits, Tanner added.\n\nThe next 10 years are likely to be very different from the first.\n\n\"As we look back into the past 10 years of WeChat development,\" Allen Zhang said on Tuesday, \"It's a process of making choices and making iterations over time.\" Additional reporting by Celia Chen\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Our happy band of rag-tag investors was supposed to use our little corner of the internet to exchange risky stock investment ideas, not take down one of America’s most prominent hedge funds. Source: Mehaniq / Shutterstock.com Yet here we are. In the past week, traders reading WSB and other forums have pushed GameStop (NYSE:GME) and a host of other highly shorted stocks to impossibly high levels, bankrupting at least one hedge fund and causing several platforms to halt trading. So ham-handed was Wall Street’s response that Congress members Ted Cruz and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, long-sworn enemies, even managed a coordinated tongue-wagging (Twitter-wagging?) at the U.S. financial system. But as Citadel picks up the pieces of Melvin Capital and Reddit users find their next short-squeeze target, people are starting to ask, “what’s next?”InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets Gives Citron a Taste Let me be clear: You won’t find my posts on r/WallStreetBets. As much as I read and enjoy the platform, my work and ethics prevent me from talking about any stock I own. (Sorry, Elon Musk. I wish I were you.) Wall Street Bets has always been about having fun. Many of the posts are intentionally moronic — think out-of-the-money calls on failing retailers — and there are plenty of contributors who show screenshots of life savings going to zero. Profitable or not, it was about finding the joys and absurdities of market speculation. Back in November, GameStop was among these fun little ventures. And it all seemed quite a standard fare for the subreddit billed as “4chan finding a Bloomberg Terminal.” GameStop fans cheered on buyers while cursing out Melvin Capital for shorting the stock. All in hopes of realizing America’s favorite pastime: making a lot of money with as little effort as possible. But then Citron Research changed it all. Citron Research? Meet r/WallStreetBets On Jan. 19, respected short-seller Andrew Left managed to finally pick the wrong target. As long-time Wall Street outsider, Mr. Left made a name for himself exposing companies like Valeant Pharmaceuticals, whose executives were channel stuffing and spiking the prices of the lifesaving drugs. He would have made a great WSB contributor, if he were willing to put up with hate speech from 15 year olds. But then something happened. The day before the presidential inauguration, Mr. Left announced he would make a case why GameStop shares were worth only $20. Perhaps Mr. Left was right to target GameStop, a shrinking company that still awarded its executives $20 million. Or he could have been wrong — at $20, GameStop would still be worth less than half of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) when adjusted for sales. But that didn’t matter one bit. Suddenly, GameStop became more than a money-making venture to Redditors. It became a way to fight back against Wall Street greed; now it was war. How Did WSB Do It? In a financial system that values a stock based on its last trade price, even tiny trades at weird prices will revalue a hedge fund’s entire holding. In other words, a few well-timed buys can cause mayhem, especially in stocks with few sellers. That’s exactly what happened with GME. Until then, short interest had remained relatively stable. Market makers, the underpinnings of the U.S. financial system, were doing their job in matching orders and sales. That all changed on Wednesday when prices jumped from $150 to $350. As market makers began to seize up, markets started going wild. That spelled problems for Robinhood. On Wednesday, Robinhood halted trading for GameStop and almost a dozen other companies. “In order to protect our firm and protect our customers,” CEO Vlad Tenev would later tell CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin, “we had to limit buying in these stocks.” Can Robinhood Go Under? In the world of trading, most conservatively-run platforms don’t have trouble managing liquidity. As long as you hold enough capital and maintain disciplined margin requirements, it’s rare for your clearinghouse to force you to raise fresh capital. But when it comes to Wall Street, financial companies all seem to run into the same issue — when your customers are making so much money, it’s hard to resist the temptation to join them. Financial regulators have long known these Wall Street shenanigans. Banks from Bear Stearns to Barings all went under when they tried trading customer money as their own, leaving taxpayers and shareholders footing the bill. Many more have experimented with bare-minimum capitalization — only later to realize their disastrous mistakes. So, over the years, smart governments have occasionally found the willpower to ban such practices and enforce strict margin and capital requirements. (Often, these rules would come undone by even smarter financial lobbyists.) Today, many platforms use a loophole to lease customer securities for profit. And when GME stock can get leased out at 25% interest rates to short-sellers, there’s a great temptation for these financial firms to double-dip. Did Robinhood do that? Possibly. Despite Robinhood’s claims that its trading shutdown was proactive, the company still drew down capital lines and banned users from buying more GameStop shares — a signal that Robinhood itself might have been short on capital and shares. (Since Robinhood is a private company, we may never know the truth.) But will Robinhood get in regulatory trouble? Almost certainly. The company banned trading in a dozen stocks on Wednesday during peak investment demand — reportedly because the company needed time to raise fresh capital. So, as retail investors watched from the sidelines, hedge funds cashed out at otherwise lower prices. In a very real sense, Robinhood arguably saved institutions billions of dollars at investors’ expense. Should We Be Scared? As Wall Street picks up the remnants of Melvin Capital and the GME fallout, two things have become clear. 1) “Dumb money” isn’t so dumb after all, and 2) “smart money” is getting taken to the woodshed. First, let’s consider what Wall Street has long called “dumb money,” the retail investor. Most of these people are like you and me — investing the majority of savings in long-term stocks for retirement, while playing around with a small portion for fun. And the gleeful absurdity of r/WallStreetBets aside, most retail investors tend to know what they’re buying (even if they get the valuations wrong sometimes.) The top-100 Robinhood stocks represent a wide swatch of consumer-related companies that have grown in real-world popularity as well as stock-related fame. Second, the GME fiasco has revealed “smart money” for the absurd bets they sometimes take. While a long-short hedge fund can help investors smooth out gains, they’re often as bad as what they call “dumb money” in closing out losses. Melvin Capital, for instance, lost 30% of its net worth in the first three weeks of January. But it took another six days (after the stock had gained another 250%) for the hedge fund to finally relinquish its mammoth position. Since then, other hedge funds have stepped up to replace Melvin in this high-stakes game of “pass the hot potato,” as if trying to prove r/WallStreetBets’ point that hedge funds will always try to make more money off regular investors if they believe the odds are right. GameStop also exposed the revolving door behind hedge funds and market makers. When Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC, a $35 billion fund, bailed out Melvin Capital, Twitter users quickly pointed out that Citadel also owns a market-making operation that services none other than Robinhood. Where to Go from Here? Investors looking to soak the financial system would do well to buy index funds and sit on them forever. You might not get the gleeful joy of seeing a hedge fund blow up, but companies like Citadel that rely on retail money will see revenues dry up. But for those looking to invest wisely, consider this. With retail investors’ newfound power, you can expect short-sellers to think twice about selling a company. Citron Research’s Andrew Left has already vowed never again to publish short-seller reports. Other hedge funds are nervously watching. That means hot stocks will move faster than ever. As Reddit users have learned this week, it doesn’t take much to influence stock prices when only the marginal trade counts. And with no one willing to short-sell stocks in the face of an angry mob, price spikes will become increasingly common. You can expect many winners and losers. The stock market, after all, is mostly a fixed-sum game. But for long-term investors, the same truth still holds: The road to consistent wealth has always been in buying a group of high-quality investments bought at a reasonable price. Practice that discipline with your core portfolio, and you’ll make plenty of merriment with joining me in reading about the trials and tribulations of others on r/WallStreetBets.

Joe Biden will be inaugurated as president today.\n\nX\n\nNetflix (NFLX) missed on earnings but beat on revenue and subscriber growth, even as Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) becomes a bigger threat with its fast-growing Disney+. Netflix stock spiked above an early entry overnight. Disney stock also rallied, offering an aggressive entry.\n\nDow Jones giant UnitedHealth Group (UNH), investment bank Morgan Stanley (MS) and chip-equipment giant ASML Holding (ASML) all beat EPS and revenue views early Wednesday. UnitedHealth stock, not far from a buy point, was litle changed. Morgan Stanley climbed modestly. ASML stock rose slightly but is greatly extended.\n\nAlibaba Soars As Jack Ma Appears\n\nAlibaba stock soared as Jack Ma resurfaced in a video aired by state media, speaking to rural school teachers. Ma had not been seen since October after making critical comments vs. Chinese regulators that spurred a crackdown on Alibaba and other internet platforms.\n\nBABA stock jumped 7%, set to regain its 50-day moving average and rallying above its 200-day line on Tuesday. JD.com (JD) and Pinduoduo (PDD), the No. 2 and No. 3 e-commerce giants in China, rose solidly.\n\nTuesday Breakouts\n\nIn Tuesday's solid stock market rally, Apple supplier Qualcomm (QCOM) cleared a buy point while Synopsys (SNPS) and 2020 medical IPOs Maravai LifeSciences (MRVI) and One Medical (ONEM) broke out.\n\nFind The Best Long-Term Investments With IBD Long-Term Leaders\n\nApple, Netflix stock and most big techs rose slightly in Tuesday's session but didn't change their character as lackluster performers.

Covid-19 deaths topped 2.06 million.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. have hit 24.80 million, with deaths above 411,000.\n\nNew U.S. Covid cases have slowed significantly in the past several days, but remain very high. Hospitalizations appear to have peaked, at least nationwide, with daily deaths also potentially at a top.\n\nCoronavirus vaccinations may speed up in the coming weeks as supply improves, state and federal guidelines on vaccine eligibility loosen and the holiday weekend season ends. Vaccination rates have tended to fall on the weekends, especially on holidays.\n\nStock Market Rally\n\nU.S. Stock Market Today Overview Index Symbol Price Gain/Loss % Change Dow Jones (0DJIA) 30930.52 +116.26 +0.38 S&P 500 (0S&P5) 3798.91 +30.66 +0.81 Nasdaq (0NDQC ) 13197.18 +198.68 +1.53 Russell 2000 (IWM) 213.50 +2.75 +1.30 IBD 50 (FFTY) 45.20 +1.02 +2.31 Last Update: 4:06 PM ET 1/19/2021\n\nThe stock market rally had a solid session, led by techs and growth names.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% in Tuesday's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.8%. The Nasdaq composite jumped 1.5%.\n\nWhile the Nasdaq closed Tuesday just below the Jan. 8 peak, it's 5.9% above the 50-day line vs. 8% on Jan. 8. However, with tech futures pointing to a record high for the Nasdaq, the composite could soon look extended once again.\n\nThe bulls vs. bears reading showed 60.4% of investment newsletter writers were bullish, down slightly from the prior week but still relatively upbeat.\n\nApple stock rose 0.5% on Tuesday to 127.83, but below its 21-day exponential moving average.\n\nAmong the best ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) climbed 2.3%, while the Innovator IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF (BOUT) surged 6.5%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) rallied 1.4%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) popped 3.4%, with QCOM and ASML stock notable components.\n\nNetflix Earnings\n\nNetflix earnings fell 8% to $1.19 a share as revenue grew 21% to $6.64 billion. Analysts expected Netflix earnings of $1.39 a share on sales of $6.62 billion.\n\nNetflix added 8.51 million new streaming subscribers, for a total of 203.66 million. At the start of the fourth quarter, it had forecast adding 6 million subscribers worldwide. Wall Street expected Netflix subscribers to rise by 6.06 million.\n\nFor the first quarter, Netflix expects to add 6 million streaming subscribers.\n\nThe internet TV giant also said it's considering a NFLX stock buyback.\n\nThe Netflix earnings and subscriber report eases concerns about Disney, which is seeing booming Disney+ subscriber gains. With its huge content library, a slew of new programming and global reach, Disney+ is a real rival.\n\nNetflix stock spiked 14% to 570 early Wednesday, flashing at least an early buy signal. Shares are in a six-month consolidation with a 575.47 buy point, with 545.60 as an early entry. NFLX stock closed up 0.8% to 501.77, continuing to struggle around the 50-day line and 21-day line.\n\nDisney stock rose 2.5% in premarket trade. After a big run, DIS stock has pulled back in the past few weeks to its 21-day and just above its 10-week average. A solid bounce could offer an aggressive entry.\n\nGoogle Stock\n\nGoogle stock rose 3.3% to 1,784.47, reclaiming its 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Investors could take an early stake in GOOGL stock now as it works on a flat base with an 1,843.93 buy point. They might want to wait until Google stock is above the Jan. 8 short-term high of 1,799.36. Shares did reach 1,803.84 intraday.\n\nGoogle stock rose about 1% early Wednesday, signaling a move just above 1,800.\n\nNote that the relative strength line has moved sideways over the past year and has trended lower since early November. That reflects Google stock's lackluster performance vs. the S&P 500 index.\n\nQualcomm Stock\n\nQCOM stock popped 4.25% to 163.77, above a flat base and its 161.17 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis. Last week, Qualcomm briefly cleared the entry but didn't close above it. The RS line for QCOM stock hit its highest level since early 2013.\n\nSynopsys Stock\n\nSynopsys stock rose 3.6% to 268.20, clearing a 264.72 entry from a three-weeks-tight pattern. That three-weeks-tight entry formed just above a prior base for SNPS stock.\n\nSynopsys software helps design semiconductors. Rival Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) rose 2.2%. CDNS stock is close to its own three-weeks-tight entry above a prior base.\n\nMaravai Stock\n\nMaravai stock leapt 10% to 30.60, rising as high as 31.69 intraday. That briefly cleared a 31.29 IPO base with a cup-with-handle shape. Investors could have bought MRVI stock as it cleared downward-sloping trend lines either from the all-time high from the Nov. 29 IPO debut or starting from the Dec. 22 handle peak.\n\nStarting a position in an IPO at a traditional buy point after rushing up from low in the base is risky because odds of a pullback are high.\n\nMRVI stock early Wednesday signaled a move back above the 31.29 entry\n\nMaravai makes a component used in the Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine. But the new IPO stock is also a leader in nucleic acid production, biologics testing and protein detection.\n\nWhy This New IPO Stock Is One To Watch In 2021 As Covid Vaccines Grow\n\nOne Medical Stock\n\nOne Medical stock rose 12% to 47.71, clearing a 44.59 buy point from a deep cup-with-handle base in heavy volume. ONEM stock is now slightly extended from the 5% chase zone.\n\nOne Medical, formally, 1Life Healthcare (ONEM), is a concierge health practice, charging an annual fee on top of typical insurance rates in exchange for faster, better care.\n\nONEM stock debuted in January 2019 at 14 a share.\n\nOne Medical Stock was the IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nRead The Big Picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and leading stocks and sectors.\n\nPlease follow Ed Carson on Twitter at @IBD_ECarson for stock market updates and more.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nWhy This IBD Tool Simplifies The Search For Top Stocks\n\nWant To Get Quick Profits And Avoid Big Losses?

            "Text": "Stocks launched an inauguration-day rally Wednesday, as Netflix earnings and rising China stocks bolstered early trade. President Donald Trump exited the White House early Wednesday, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. China stocks continued their recent rally, led by Alibaba Group, which surged as founder Jack Ma resurfaced. Strong fourth-quarter subscriber growth sent Netflix stock soaring, and also helped boost Walt Disney to the top of the Dow Jones today.\n\nX\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average jumped 145 points, up about 0.4% with Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) and Caterpillar (CAT) trading at the bottom of the list. The S&P 500 bolted 0.6% higher, while the Nasdaq launched into an early 1.3% advance on the stock market today.\n\nStocks in buy ranges or near buy points early Wednesday included Netflix, JD.com, Pinduoduo (PDD) and Maravai Lifesciences (MRVI).\n\nNetflix (NFLX) paced both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, up 145% at the starting bell, despite a mixed fourth-quarter report. On the Nasdaq, China-based stocks crowded in behind Netflix, with Baidu (BIDU), JD.com (JD) and NetEase (NTES) all atop the Nasdaq 100.\n\nThe iShares MSCI China ETF (MCHI) jumped 3% in opening trade.\n\nHeavy truck maker Paccar (PCAR) also ran high on both the Nasdaq and S&P 500, up 4% after Vertical Research initiated coverage with a hold rating and a 95 price target. Paccar stock is below a 95.92 buy point in an 11-week flat base. Automakers General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor (F) also rallied, following analyst price target hikes.\n\nAmong companies reporting early Wednesday, Morgan Stanley (MS) gained 1.9%. ASML Holding (ASML) posted a 0.5% gain after reporting a strong fourth-quarter performance. Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and U.S. Bancorp (USB) dropped 6% and 4.2%, respectively, on earnings news.\n\nThe economic calendar was fairly quiet Wednesday. But homebuilding stocks could see some impact when the National Association of Home Builders releases its January builders confidence survey, due out at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nTransfer Of Power\n\nWashington, D.C., remained locked down tight as the clock ticked toward the inauguration of Biden, scheduled for 12 p.m. ET. Biden traveled to the capital Tuesday night by plane, eliminating security concerns regarding a Wednesday-morning Amtrak ride from Wilmington, Del. President Trump left the White House and held an 8 a.m. ET farewell ceremony at Joint Base Andrews, after which he boarded Air Force One, reportedly traveling to his Mar-A-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla.\n\nNetflix Stock: Q4 Earnings and A Possible Breakout\n\nNetflix reported 8.51 million new streaming subscribers during the fourth quarter, far above Wall Street expectations for a 6.06 million increase. That salved the larger-than-estimated 8% decline in earnings. Revenue jumped 21%, just above projections.\n\nNetflix stock spiked 13% Wednesday, a move that sent shares briefly above a buy point at 575.47 in a sloppy, 28-week base. The also marked a breakout past an early, alternative buy point at 545.60.\n\nDow Jones Today: Disney Gets A Netflix Boost\n\nNetflix's report of strong subscriber growth also boosted Walt Disney (DIS) shares 2.1%, high the Dow Jones today. Disney stock is consolidating below a Dec. 31 high, wrestling to hold support at its 21-day exponential moving average, and up a bit more than 30% from a Nov. 9 breakout.\n\nDow Jones peer Salesforce.com (CRM) jumped 2.7% after Credit Suisse raised the enterprise software leader's price target to 260 from 245. Salesforce stock is beaten down iover the past four months. But Wednesday's action marked a second day rebounding from support at the stock's 40-week moving average.\n\nChina Stocks Active: Hong Kong Rally Continues, Jack Ma Returns\n\nChina-based stocks were again active on Wednesday, after Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.1%. That left the index at a 20-month high and up 4.9% for the week through Wednesday, as it tracks toward a fourth-straight weekly advance. Money flowing from the mainland south through the Hong Kong Stock Connect reached a record $39 billion on Wednesday, according to the Wall Street Journal. Much of those funds went into stocks placed off-limits to U.S. investors by a White House order in November.\n\nStock Market ETF Strategy And How To Invest In The Current Uptrend\n\nIn U.S. trade, Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) rallied more than 6%, after company founder Jack Ma made his first appearance since disappearing from public view in October. Ma delivered a video speech to 100 rural Chinese teachers on Wednesday morning, according to the South China Morning Post. Ma had retreated from public view after a speech critical of the Chinese government's handling of the financial system. Alibaba Group owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nAlibaba shares are rising for a fourth week from a late December low. The stock retook its 200-day moving average on Tuesday, and is poised to regain support at its 10-week line early Wednesday.\n\nBaidu rallied 3%. Baidu stock finished Tuesday up more than 85% since clearing a flat base buy point at 135.54 in October.\n\nOnline flash sale apparel retailer JD.com climbed 2.8% in early action. JD.com shares have been pinned between their 21-day moving average and a cup-base buy point a 92.87 since Jan. 5. The stock closed 2% below the buy point on Tuesday.\n\nIBD 50/Leaderboard: Futu's Hold Rule, Pinduoduo's Buy Point\n\nIBD 50 stock Futu Holdings (FUTU) spiked 13% in early action. The Hong Kong-based online trading platform ended Tuesday up 58% following a breakout above a cup-based buy point at 51.20 on Jan. 5. The gain triggered the eight-week hold rule for a second time in two months. Futu is a non-U.S.-based, volatile stock, so the hold rule comes with some caveats. But it served investors well following the stock's mid-November breakout.\n\nLeaderboard stock Pinduoduo climbed 3.8%. The developer of mobile e-commerce software, headquartered in Shanghai, ended Tuesday about 11% below a 187.80 buy point in what IBD MarketSmith analysis identifies as a 10-week ascending base.\n\nAlso on the Leaderboard list, Maravai Lifesciences Holdings swung 5.4% higher. The San Diego-based drug products supplier is in a buy range above a 31.29 buy point in an IPO base with a cup-with-handle shape. The buy range runs to 32.85.\n\nDow Jones Today: UnitedHealth, P&G Earnings\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) shed 0.5%, dragging on the Dow Jones today after reporting a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings, and a larger-than-forecast increase in revenue. UnitedHealth shares are consolidating in a 10-week flat base, and closed Tuesday less than 5% below a 368.05 buy point.\n\nDow peer Procter & Gamble (PG) traded 0.5% lower, after reporting Q2 revenue and earnigns above analyst estimates. Full year 2021 earnigns guidance was a shade light. Shares have been in a downgtrend since mid-November.\n\nDow Jones stocks Travelers (TRV), Intel (INTC) and IBM (IBM) are due to report on Thursday.\n\nFind Alan R.

            "Text": "Alibaba stock jumped Wednesday as billionaire Jack Ma was seen in public for the first time in three months and coming at a time when Hong-Kong listed stocks overall have been setting new highs.\n\nX\n\nMa, the co-founder of Alibaba (BABA), resurfaced in a video aired by state media, speaking to rural schoolteachers. He had not been seen in public since Oct. 24. His disappearance came after comments he made that were critical of Chinese regulators, speaking about his desire to bring financial freedom to Chinese businesses and consumers.\n\nThe comments by Ma sparked a crackdown on Alibaba and other China internet companies. It also led to the suspension of a blockbuster $37 billion initial public offering for Alibaba's financial affiliate Ant Group. The Ant IPO would have been the largest ever. Ma is the largest shareholder of Ant, which was spun out of Alibaba.\n\nChinese authorities subsequently launched a probe into Alibaba for alleged anticompetitive behaviors on its e-commerce platform, which hit China stocks.\n\nAction In Alibaba Stock\n\nAfter Ma resurfaced, the Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba surged 8.5% Wednesday. That lifted Alibaba's market cap by $58 billion.\n\nOn the New York Stock Exchange, Alibaba stock jumped 5.5%, closing at 265.49 on the stock market today.\n\nOther China stocks getting a jolt Wednesday included JD.com (JD), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY), Pinduoduo (PDD) and Baidu (BIDU).\n\nTencent shares climbed 2.5% to 88.07. JD.com leapt 4.6% to 95.31. In addition, Pinduoduo edged up 1.3% to 170.96. Baidu climbed 4.2%, to 260.90.\n\nMoreover, the benchmark Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong is trading at its highest level since April 2019. The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is at its highest level in three years.\n\nBig Money Flowing Into Hong Kong Stocks\n\nA report from KraneShares, the provider of China exchange traded funds, said the Southbound Stock Connect, which is the trading venue allowing investors in mainland China to buy Hong Kong stocks, \"had another monster day overnight as Mainland investors bought $2.6 billion worth of Hong Kong stocks\" on Wednesday. That followed the prior day's record purchase of $3.4 billion worth of Hong Kong stocks by mainland investors.\n\nAmong other good news for China stocks and internet companies, the Ministry of Commerce reported that online retail sales of goods jumped 14.8% to $1.5 trillion in 2020. Online retail sales accounted for 25% of total retail sales.\n\nPlans for the Ant Group IPO gave a big boost to Alibaba stock. Alibaba was to have a roughly 33% stake in the IPO.\n\nIf you want to invest in a large-cap stock, a comprehensive selection of articles is here.

BABA, +1.12% shot up 7.3% toward a more than 6-week high in premarket trading Wednesday, putting them on track for a fifth-straight gain, after co-founder Jack Ma made his first public appearance in nearly three months. The rally in the China-based internet giant's shares puts them on track to open at the highest price seen during regular-session hours since Dec. 4. A spokesperson for the Jack Ma Foundation confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that Ma participated in the online ceremony of the annual Rural Teacher Initiative event on Jan. 20. Ma hasn't been seen in public since Oct. 24, when Ma spoke at a financial forum and criticized regulators for stifling financial and technological innovation, as the WSJ reported. That led to regulators to derail Ant Group Co., which Ma controls, from going public. Since Ma's last public appearance through Tuesday, Alibaba's stock had dropped 18.8%, while the iShares MSCI China ETF MCHI, +1.85% rose 13.0% and the S&P 500 SPX, +0.68% advanced 9.6%."

In one video of the event circulated on social media, China’s most famous entrepreneur can be seen touring a primary school in his hometown of Hangzhou.\n\nA former English schoolteacher, Ma spoke about the importance of reviving China’s countryside and narrowing income disparities by encouraging the return of younger talent to rural areas.\n\n“Recently, my colleagues and I have been studying and thinking. We made a firmer resolution to devote ourselves to education philanthropy,” Ma said. “Working hard for rural revitalization and common prosperity is the responsibility for our generation of businessmen.”\n\nIt was the first appearance and first public remarks from Ma, who had stayed out of public view since regulators suspended the highly anticipated initial public offering of his fintech company Ant Group.\n\nMa had kept out of public view since regulators scuttled the $35 billion IPO, tightened fintech regulations and launched a separate probe into Alibaba - all in a span of weeks.\n\nSpeculation about Ma’s whereabouts and his standing with China President Xi Jinping’s government has escalated more recently after regulators ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began the antitrust investigation of Alibaba.\n\nBeijing’s crackdown followed an October speech by Ma in which he ruffled establishment feathers after rebuking “pawn shop” Chinese lenders, regulators who don’t get the internet, and the “old men” of the global banking community.\n\nShares of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant co-founded by Ma that owns about a third of Ant, jumped 8.5% in Hong Kong.

Let's look at the charts to see the trade.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) - Get Report shares were hitting one-month highs, rising about 5.5% in Wednesday’s trading session.\n\nWhat’s driving the rally? Co-founder Jack Ma has made a public appearance in China after being off the radar for several months.\n\nAdmittedly, this is a very strange headline to be driving a stock. But the catalysts for the recent decline have been strange too.\n\nThe stock was hitting new all-time highs in late October as it neared Singles Day and the holidays. However, shares were quickly cut down on issues with the initial public offering of Ant.\n\nThen there were worries about not seeing Ma for a while, as well as concerns over whether the stock would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThese concerns have been alleviated to some degree and we’re seeing the pop in the share price as a result.\n\nTrading Alibaba\n\nDaily chart of Alibaba stock. Chart courtesy of TrendSpider.com\n\nLook at that painful decline in Alibaba stock as shares tumbled from a high near $320 to a low near $211 in a little under two months.\n\nOn the ensuing rebound, shares struggled with the 10-day moving average, which acted as resistance.\n\nLate last week, shares gapped up over this measure, then a few days later reclaimed the 200-day moving average and filled the gap from Dec. 23 near $252.50.\n\nWith Wednesday’s jolt, shares are now near $265 and in the short term, I’d say it’s in a bit of no man’s land here.\n\nOn the upside, we have the 100-day moving average and 61.8% retracement between $273 and $277.50. On the downside, we have the 50-day and 200-day moving averages between $250 and $255, with that gap level I just mentioned sandwiched in between.\n\nIn this respect, I want to see how Alibaba handles whichever area comes first. Should the stock chop sideways, look for it to find potential support at the 10-day moving average, which was resistance on the way down. The hope is that it’s now support on the way up.\n\nIf Alibaba loses the $250 mark and its key moving averages, look for a potential gap-fill down toward $240.\n\nAbove the 61.8% retracement puts $290.50 on the table, which was the start of a nasty decline amid a gap down in early November."

Nasdaq futures jumped 120 points following strong earnings from Netflix (NFLX) - Get Report.\n\nStocks closed higher Tuesday as Biden’s nominee for Treasury secretary, former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, told Congress that lawmakers must do more to lift the U.S. economy out of the recession brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nYellen, who could be confirmed as soon as Thursday, said she'd focus on America’s workers as treasury secretary, adding that providing assistance for the unemployed and small businesses would provide the “biggest bang for the buck.”\n\n“If most of this is implemented, it does suggest significant pickup in economic growth as we head through to the fourth quarter of this year,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.\n\nYellen, who served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014-2018, did encounter Republican resistance, however, to Biden’s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan at her confirmation hearing.\n\n“Now is not the time to enact a laundry list of liberal structural economic reforms,” said Republican Sen Chuck Grassley of Iowa.\n\n2. -- Netflix Surges as Subscribers Surpass 200 Million\n\nNetflix was rising more than 13% in premarket trading Wednesday after the streaming service added more paid subscribers than expected in the fourth quarter and surpassed 200 million streaming subscribers for the first time at the end of 2020.\n\nThe company also said free cash flow in 2021 would be \"around break even.\"\n\n\"Combined with our $8.2 billion cash balance and our $750 million undrawn credit facility, we believe we no longer have a need to raise external financing for our day-to-day operations,\" the company said.\n\nThe stock jumped 13.41% to $569.05.\n\nNetflix, the No. 1 streaming service, added 8.51 million paid net subscribers in the fourth quarter, beating its own forecast and the Wall Street estimate of 6.19 million.\n\nEarnings in the period were $1.19 a share on revenue of $6.64 billion, an increase of 21.5% from a year earlier. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.39 a share on revenue of $6.63 billon.\n\n\"We’re enormously grateful that in these uniquely challenging times we’ve been able to provide our members around the world with a source of escape, connection and joy while continuing to build our business,\" the company said in its earnings release.\n\nFor the first quarter, Netflix expects earnings of $2.97 a share on revenue of $7.13. Wall Street predicts earnings of $2.10 a share on revenue of $7.02 billion.\n\nThe company issued a conservative forecast for new subscriber growth in the first quarter, saying it expects to add 6 million subscribers, below analysts' forecasts of 7.45 million.\n\n3. -- Wednesday's Calendar: UnitedHealth, P&G and Morgan Stanley Earnings\n\nUnitedHealth (UNH) - Get Report reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $2.52 a share vs. analysts' estimates of $2.41.

And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings.

            "Date": "2021-01-21",
            "Headline": "Jack Ma's Worth and Influence",
            "Text": "What is Jack Ma, founder and executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.(BABA), worth? As of Jan. 13, 2021, Jack Ma's net worth is $51.1 billion as the 25th richest person in the world, according to Bloomberg.﻿﻿﻿\n\nThat's no sum to scoff at, though Forbes had named Jack Ma as the 33rd-richest person in the world and 8th-richest in the tech industry in 2016. Back then, his net worth was just $34 billion—a jump from the $20.5 billion he had following the initial public offering (IPO) of Alibaba on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014. Notably, that $25 billion IPO was the largest IPO in history.\n\nMuch of Ma’s wealth is linked to Alibaba. He used to own an 11.7% stake with the largest controlling interest in the company and its subsidiaries, though he has been divesting his shares over time. In July 2020, he sold another $8.2 billion worth of shares, leaving him most recently with a 4.8% stake in the company.﻿﻿﻿ (Softbank Group currently has the largest stake in the company at approximately 25%, among its other top investors.) The firm's roots date back to 1995, when Ma and his wife started a site-creating company called China Yellow Pages. Less than five years later, Ma co-founded Alibaba with 17 friends in Hangzhou.\n\n4.8% Jack Ma's stake in Alibaba.\n\nAlibaba’s holdings now include outright ownership and or important ownership stakes in a movie studio, venture capital funds, Yahoo! China, healthcare technology makers, Internet messaging and voice apps, supply chain management companies, taxi-hailing app services, video streaming sites, social media apps, and online clothing retailers.\n\nMa stepped down as Chairman of Alibaba on September 10, 2019, on his 55th birthday, as part of a long-standing succession plan.\n\nWhen a person makes Forbes’ The World’s Billionaires list, investors are naturally interested in what they're investing in.\n\nBuffet-Style Investing\n\nWith a wide array of investments spread out over a number of different companies and sectors, Ma’s web of deals and diversification are often likened to that of Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK) fame. Ma is a prolific investor who is not shy of financing all stages of a venture, from seed funding to established company. Much of his investing has been done through Yunfeng Capital or various shell companies.\n\nMa established venture capital firm Yunfeng Capital with four associates in 2010. The five principals came to be known as the “Zhejiang Gang,” referring to the province where they were born. Yunfeng, invests in early-stage companies across a number of industries; almost all of of the companies are located in China. Yunfeng investment sectors include:\n\nHealthcare (the fund, for example, put $142 million into China Resources Wandong Medical Equipment Co. Ltd. [Shanghai: 600055.SS], a maker of medical devices),\n\nInsurance ($1.7 billion worth of shares in China Taiping Insurance Holdings Company Limited [HKSE: 0966.HK])\n\nMass media\n\nClean energy\n\nConsumer goods\n\nFinance (with a 56% stake in REORIENT Group Limited (HKSE: 0376.HK), a mid-cap brokerage located in Hong Kong)\n\nTechnology\n\nInternet products and services\n\nPrivate Investments\n\nNot all of Ma's funds are invested in public companies; a large portion of his wealth is invested privately, through various connections and holding companies. One such private equity fund is Star Capital, which invests in a variety of business sectors, including real estate, in China and across Europe. Star Capital is majority-controlled by Fosun International. A major part of Alibaba’s financial services businesses, including Alipay, is overseen by another holding company that is controlled by Ma and other investors.\n\nIn 2014, Jack Ma and several other investors put up $1 billion to purchase a 20% stake in Wasu Media, (Shenzhen: 000156.SZ). While this transaction may look fairly straightforward, a closer look at the way the deal was structured revealed a somewhat complex arrangement.\n\nThe Hangzhou Yunxi Investment Partnership Enterprise, which made the investment on behalf of its three partners, including Ma, is controlled by three separate entities. One of those, Hangzhou Yun Huang Investment Management, is 99% controlled by Ma, with the other 1% owned by Simon Xie. The $1 billion loan was made to Xie from Alibaba, and then invested into the Yunxi partnership for the purchase of the Wasu shares. Taking a very circuitous route, Ma was investing personally in Wasu, and his appetite for media.\n\nMedia, Sports, and Entertainment\n\nThe Huayi Brothers (Shenzhen: 300027.SZ) entertainment company, originally formed in 1994, is just one example of Ma's growing interest. Yunfeng, Chinese Internet giant Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC: TCTZF), and Huayi purchased controlling interests in it through an empty shell corporation called China Jiuhao Health Industry Corporation Limited (HKSE: 0419.HK).\n\nIn January 2019, Alibaba's Pictures Group (a subsidiary of Alibaba) extended a $1 million loan to Huayi Brothers. In return, Huayi pledged to produce 10 theatrical films over the next five years, giving Alibaba Pictures priority as a potential investor, distributor, and merchandiser.\n\nIn 2015, Yunfeng participated in an initial funding round of $129 million for Le TV Sports, a then-fledgling sports rights and streaming company, that went on to secure $1.2 billion in Series B funding in 2016.\n\nJack Ma's Causes\n\nMa is a charismatic, flamboyant, and energetic leader, and his influence in business and leadership has been recognized by various organizations. He was named one of the world’s most influential people by Time Magazine in 2009, Businessperson of the Year in 2007 by Businessweek, Asia’s Heroes of Philanthropy in 2010 by Forbes Asia, one of 30 world’s best CEOs by Barron’s in 2008 and 2001, he made the list of young global leaders by the World Economic Forum.\n\nHis influence has transcended business into social causes, primarily environmental ones. Ma has been a board member of The Nature Conservancy in China since 2010. He has taken on the shark fishing industry, pledging to end the consumption of shark fin dishes, and working to bring about the end of trading fins and other shark-based products on Alibaba.\n\nA small (but meaningful in absolute value) percentage of Alibaba’s profits are allocated to fund environmental causes. Ma has also begun sounding the alarm bells (albeit cautiously) on the environmental impact of China's fast-developing industrial economy. He is advocating for China to take steps to further diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on manufacturing.\n\nMa is an active advocate for women’s fair treatment and advancement in business. Within Alibaba, approximately 47% of the employees are women, and 33% of senior management are women, he has asserted, adding proudly, \"We have many women CEOs, CFOs, directors and so on.\"\n\nHe also aims to use his influence to encourage and advance fledging business owners. \"For the rest of my life, I want to encourage entrepreneurship, to help more small and midsize enterprises,\" he has stated. He is also flirting with the idea of returning to his academic roots—he is a graduate of Hangzhou Teacher's Institute —someday. \"I want to go back to school because I was trained to be a school teacher,\" says Ma. \"I have been doing business for 15 years, and I think most of the things that I learned from the business school are not correct—I want to go back and share with others.\"\n\nExpanding Access to Capital Through Alibaba\n\nMa also suggests that various Alibaba ventures have a philanthropic bent. In 2016, he coined the term \"TechFin\" as a way to not only set the company's payment platform Alipay apart from its competitors, but to underscore the company's goal of providing young people, small companies, and poor nations access to capital.\n\nHe wants Alibaba, already the world's largest e-commerce platform, to also be the go-to financier for emerging markets. And the company's Alipay e-wallet service, which boasts more than 600 million users, is going to serve as the backbone for Ma's payment platform expansion efforts.\n\n“Fintech takes the original financial system and improves its technology,” said Ma during Friday’s China Conference organized by the South China Morning Post (SCMP). “TechFin is to rebuild the system with technology. What we want to do is to solve the problem of a lack of inclusiveness.”\n\nThe Post, a publication owned by Alibaba, quoted Ma as saying, \"Everyone should have a bank account.\" To that end, Alibaba’s financial services affiliate Ant Financial Services Group (which manages Alipay) has begun to focus on emerging markets such as India, the Philippines, and Malaysia—areas that are considered underserved, compared to established markets like Europe and the United States.\n\nAnt also runs Yu’E Bao, a money market fund launched in 2013 that offers higher interest on savings and greater liquidity than many of China's traditional banks.\n\nAs for how Alipay and the concept of \"TechFin\" stands up against existing payment platforms, Ma described his ambition as being less about competition and more about solving a problem. “It’s not a business model competition ... getting a business model is simple if you really solve a big problem and create value,” the Washington Post quoted him as saying. “In India, we have over 150 million users who can run mobile payments within 20 months. This [enabling the poor to have bank accounts] is something we feel proud of.”"

            "Text": "In this article we are going to list the 15 largest global IPOs of all time. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 largest global IPOs of all time.\n\nMost people hate having to work 9-5 in an office, where they have to get up really early, get dressed, fight rush hour traffic, get late, work for a boss you inevitably do not like and then beating rush hour traffic again only to get barely a few hours to yourself and still be living pay check to pay check. This is why many people want to become entrepreneurs and establish their own company. Sure, it may be really hard work but at least you're only answerable to yourself and whatever money you earn, you get to keep instead of a salary which often does not justify the work you're doing.\n\nOf course, starting a company has a lot of other complications as well, in addition to working hard. First things first, you need capital to be able to start a business. You will always need some money initially, with the amount that you require depending on the company and the industry you're in. Most people either get investors initially to pony up the capital, pool in their own resources and / or get loans from banks. Now, to get loans from banks, you need to have a really good credit rating as well as sufficient assets which are often held for lien against the loan provided. Hence, if you are just an ordinary Joe, with few assets and without an excellent credit rating, few banks will take a risk and provide you with the loan.\n\nRemember, when a business starts, you aren't expecting to earn profits immediately. There's a lot of initial investment and expenses required, while revenues are inconsistent as you are still trying to build up your customer base and economies of scale aren't present either. And while the money may be sufficient for an initial start up or a new or a small company, your requirement for capital consistently increases as your company grows. And this is where IPOs come in.\n\nStory continues\n\n15 largest global IPOs of all time\n\nCopyright: argus456 / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nAn IPO is what we call an initial public offering. As the name suggests, it refers to shares of the company being offered to the general public, who purchase them for a specific price. Once the IPO is done, the shares continue to be publicly traded, and the price of the shares adjusts accordingly. Now as I mentioned earlier, companies take part in IPOs to get more money from shareholders so that they use this money to grow even more. This is why most of the biggest companies in the US and the world, and even many mid sized companies, are publicly traded. For example, Cargill is the biggest private company in the United States by revenue, and yet isn't even one of the 20 biggest companies in the country, which are all publicly traded. But why do shareholders invest in companies? What sort of returns do they get? Well, shareholders get returns in two forms; either through a dividend even though there are many companies, even major companies which don't pay a dividend. The other method is simply the value of the share price increasing as the company continues to perform well and being able to sell the shares for a profit.\n\nNow maybe you're wondering why doesn't every single company have an IPO then? Surely, more money is equal to more success and there are no downsides at all, right? Well, not exactly. The first thing that happens when you have an IPO is that you are no longer the sole owner of your company. Every person who buys a share owns a percentage of the company, while the percentage is based on the total number of shares purchased by the person divided by the total number of outstanding shares of a company. Contrary to popular belief, you can still own a public company if you own or control more than 50% of the shares, or at least the voting shares. Another important thing to note in this aspect is that a public's companies responsibilities are vastly greater than that of a private company. Among other things, you are required to disclose and material information as soon as it occurs and there are a whole host of investor related duties the company has to execute such as disclosing all financial data as well. This is why public companies publish annual accounts while private companies do not have to disclose such data at all.\n\nNow, there is always a lot of speculation as well as interest in companies having an IPO as they are often some of the hottest companies around. The biggest IPO in history took place in December 2019, and had a lot of media and fanfare accompanying it as well. Even very recently, the biggest IPO in history was supposed to take place in China, with Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) (which also had a record IPO in 2014), having been expected to go public. The company was expected to be worth around $313 billion, which would make it one of the biggest companies in the world. However, extremely controversially, China refused to allow the listing to go forward, and rumors are that the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping himself refused the listing. The fact that this literally happened just a day before the listing took place also lends credence to the rumors which state that it was the government which refused the listing.\n\nThe 15 largest global IPOs of all time are worth more than $240 billion. Remember, this is not the total market cap of all these companies, but just the value of the shares which were issued din the IPO. Most of the major IPOs have taken place in the last 2 decades with only 4 of the top 15 taking place before 2000. We will also tell you about their inflation adjusted numbers just for information purposes. The earliest IPO in our list is from 1996 only.

Instead, the interest is mostly on momentum. For the most part, this approach has gotten… well… crazy! The phenomenon of Reddit investors has taken Wall Street by storm — and has even threatened the stability of billion-dollar hedge funds.

And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels.

Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings.

And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock.

            "Date": "2021-01-22",
            "Headline": "Where Will Alibaba Be in 1 Year?",
            "Text": "The past year has been a volatile one for Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), China's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. The stock price fell with the broader market as the COVID-19 pandemic hit China in early 2020, but rebounded as its online sales rose and stay-at-home measures boosted the usage of its cloud services.\n\nHowever, a series of regulatory challenges abruptly ended Alibaba's rally at the end of the year. Chinese regulators suspended the long-awaited IPO of Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant Group, fined Alibaba for its unapproved takeover of InTime Retail, then launched an antitrust probe into its e-commerce business.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"disappearance\" of Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, rumors of China's plans to nationalize Alibaba and Ant, delisting threats in the U.S., and the Pentagon's desire to add Alibaba and Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) to an investment blacklist over their alleged ties to the Chinese military all cast a dark cloud over the stock.\n\nHowever, Jack Ma recently reappeared in public, and the Treasury Department blocked the Pentagon's push against Tencent and Alibaba shortly before President Joe Biden was inaugurated. Alibaba's stock rebounded after those developments, but it's still underperformed many of its peers. Alibaba's stock has risen about 17% over the past 12 months, while Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent have rallied 87% and 71%, respectively.\n\nWill Alibaba catch up to its \"BAT\" peers this year? Or will it continue to struggle as regulators kneecap its core businesses and allow rivals like JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) to gain ground?\n\nIs Alibaba's business still fundamentally strong?\n\nAlibaba controlled 56% of China's e-commerce market last year, according to eMarketer. JD.com and Pinduoduo held 17.1% and 10.5% of the market, respectively. All three companies operate different business models.\n\nAlibaba's main marketplaces, Taobao and Tmall, are primarily paid listing platforms. It doesn't take on any inventories, but it fulfills orders through its logistics subsidiary Cainiao. JD.com takes on inventories and fulfills its orders with its first-party logistics network. Pinduoduo offers paid listings like Alibaba, but it encourages shoppers to team up on bulk purchases.\n\nAlibaba generates most of its revenue and all of its profits from its core commerce business, which includes all its online marketplaces, brick-and-mortar stores, and logistics services. It subsidizes the growth of its three other unprofitable businesses -- Alibaba Cloud, its digital media and entertainment unit, and its innovation initiatives -- with the profits from its core commerce business.\n\nThis cycle enables Alibaba to expand its ecosystem with other services, including streaming media, cloud services, video games, and even a search engine, to widen its moat against Tencent, Baidu, and other tech giants. It's also enabled Alibaba to generate robust revenue and net income growth over the past five years:\n\nGrowth (YOY) 2017 2018 2019 2020 6M 2021** Revenue 56% 58% 51% 35% 32% Net Income* 35% 44% 12% 42% 33%\n\nAnalysts expect Alibaba's growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, and for its revenue and earnings to rise 48% and 35%, respectively, for the full year. However, investors shouldn't place too much faith in those forecasts, which might not fully reflect the impact of China's recent antitrust moves against Alibaba's e-commerce business.\n\nUnpredictable headwinds ahead\n\nThe growth of Alibaba's online marketplaces was already decelerating prior to the antitrust probe, and the company had grown increasingly dependent on lower-margin businesses -- including brick-and-mortar stores, wholesale channels, cross-border marketplaces, and Cainiao -- to boost its core commerce revenue.\n\nThat's why the adjusted EBITA margin of Alibaba's core commerce business dropped to 35% in the second quarter, down from 38% in both the first quarter and the prior-year quarter. That decline might seem minor, but that downward trend could continue and impair Alibaba's ability to support its other unprofitable businesses.\n\nTo make matters worse, China's antitrust regulators reportedly plan to prevent Alibaba from locking merchants into exclusive deals. JD, Pinduoduo, and several merchants have called these deals -- which bar Alibaba's sellers from cross-listing their products on other platforms -- anticompetitive. If those new rules are passed, Alibaba's merchants could list their products on other platforms and cause unprecedented challenges for Taobao and Tmall.\n\nThe road ahead\n\nAlibaba currently trades at just 20 times forward earnings, compared to forward P/E ratios of 29 and 21 for Tencent and Baidu, respectively.\n\nAlibaba's stock certainly looks cheap, but it arguably faces more regulatory headwinds than Tencent and Baidu. Tencent's recent mergers and fintech businesses are being scrutinized, but its core gaming, social media, and advertising businesses remain fairly secure. Baidu is widely considered an underdog in China's evolving tech market, despite owning the country's largest search engine, so it isn't a major antitrust target either.\n\nI believe Alibaba's valuation will limit its downside potential this year, but I also believe it will underperform Tencent, Baidu, and other Chinese tech stocks as China's antitrust regulators find new ways to rein in its dominant e-commerce and cloud businesses. Therefore, it's still a decent long-term play on China's growing tech sector, but investors shouldn't expect it to generate big market-beating returns this year."

            "Headline": "Do You Own These 3 Top Tech Stocks Yet?",
            "Text": "After a stock has risen, investors' tendency is to think about where the price used to be. As a result, many hesitate before making a purchase -- a phenomenon known as anchoring. But the right decision is often the opposite action. Businesses that have a proven track record of success, and thus have a rising stock price over time, are some of the best ones to buy.\n\nSpeaking of businesses flying high right now, three Fool.com contributors think NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Fastly (NYSE:FSLY), and Sea (NYSE:SE) are worth considering if you don't own them yet -- even after triple-digit percentage returns in 2020. Here's why.\n\nThe future leader in computing power?\n\nNicholas Rossolillo (NVIDIA): This top semiconductor company is no secret. Driven by its graphics processing technology (historically the realm of high-end video games), NVIDIA has been finding all sorts of new outlets for its chip designs. Shares are up over 1,900% over the last five-year stretch alone as a result.\n\nAt this point, there's no denying NVIDIA trades for a hefty price tag. Shares currently trade for a respective 23 and 81 times trailing-12-month sales and free cash flow. That kind of valuation is usually reserved for small but fast-growing up-and-coming businesses. But with a market cap of over $340 billion, this is nothing less than a tech juggernaut.\n\nBut before you think you've missed the boat forever, here's why I'm still buying: NVIDIA is still growing incredibly fast and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Through the first nine months of 2020, the company's revenue surged 49% compared to a year ago. Management's outlook for the fourth quarter is for another 54% year-over-year increase in sales to $4.8 billion. All of that immediate-term growth is already factored into the current price. But NVIDIA is using its present momentum to set itself up for rapid expansion over the course of the next decade and beyond.\n\nThe company is in the process of acquiring ARM Holdings, a leader in semiconductor design and licensing. NVIDIA is also at the heart of the growing AI industry, which tech researcher IDC thinks will double in size by 2024 and reach $110 billion a year in global spending. The graphics specialist is also disrupting the massive cloud industry, releasing multiple new hardware designs in the last year to gobble up share of the modern data center and plenty of new software built on its hardware's capabilities. And NVIDIA continues to uncover plenty of other uses for its chips at a rapid pace, helping researchers across multiple industries from healthcare (genomics and medical imaging) to transportation (autonomous cars and robotics). If you haven't bought NVIDIA yet and have 10 years to wait, this is a top-notch play in the world of next-gen computing.\n\nGrab this skyrocketing networking stock while you can\n\nAnders Bylund (Fastly): Content delivery networks (CDN) are all the rage these days and Fastly is an up-and-coming provider of premium services in that space.\n\nThe company is digging a moat to separate itself from older and larger industry peers such as Akamai Technologies in a couple of ways. Fastly's network includes edge computing tools at every connection point, which lets customers build advanced data processing solutions closer to their own end users and customers. Signing up for Fastly's services is a simple point-and-click experience, while Akamai requires that you negotiate a deal with one of their sales reps. Fastly's business model is tailor-made for enterprise customers with advanced data processing needs, but the company also caters directly to the ever-changing needs of smaller businesses.\n\nFastly's share prices have quadrupled in 52 weeks, but the stock still trades nearly 30% below the annual highs of October. This volatile stock is a day trader's nightmare but it's also a great buy at nearly any price for investors with a long-haul focus. The company is addressing a massive market worth roughly $35 billion per year, and Fastly's trailing sales of $267 million barely scratched the surface of that huge opportunity.\n\nBuy Fastly today and watch it mature over the next 5 to 10 years, ignoring the market noise along the way.\n\nThe next FAANG or BAT in the making is still a buy\n\nBilly Duberstein (Sea Limited): Sure, the large-cap internet FAANG stocks are nice, as are their their counterparts, the \"BAT\" in China (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent Holdings). But with these behemoths already trading at very large market caps, the potential for massive multi-bagger returns in a short amount of time may be over.\n\nHowever, another massive internet platform in the making could be Sea Limited, which appears to be assuming the throne in Southeast Asia, along with a recent entrance into South America -- two under-penetrated geographies in terms of digital services and e-commerce.\n\nSea Limited is kind of like a mixture of Tencent and Alibaba; of note, Tencent has a roughly 25% stake in Sea Limited, and helped the company launch its initial Garena video gaming platform back in 2010. Sea Limited then launched its payment platform now named SeaMoney in 2014, then Shopee, its e-commerce platform, in 2015.\n\nIn just the past few years, Sea Limited has proven its ability to out-execute competitors in not one but all of these fields, and in each of the major Southeast Asian countries. It hit a grand slam home run with its first-ever in-house developed game in the free-to-play Free Fire late in 2017, which has become a massive international hit. Even three years later, Free Fire helped power Sea's digital entertainment revenue 72.9% higher in the third quarter, with active users up 78% and paying users up 124%.\n\nShopee has miraculously catapulted to become the leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia in just five short years, with 103% gross merchandise volume growth last quarter and revenue skyrocketing 173%. Given the under-penetration of e-commerce in the region, there is still massive upside there.\n\nMeanwhile, while SeaMoney is a relatively small part of the business, Sea saw a huge increase in adoption, with financial services revenue up eight times the year-ago quarter. Sea also just obtained a digital banking license in Singapore, one of only four companies to obtain one, and then acquired Indonesia's PT Bank Kesejahteraan Ekonomi (Bank BKE) earlier in January.\n\nClearly, Sea Limited is in an aggressive full-court press to establish itself as the dominant consumer ecosystem in Southeast Asia, a region with over 600 million people, and where digital services still have room to grow. And it has its eyes on South America, a region with another 600 million-plus people.\n\nWhile Sea looks expensive on just about any metric based on current earnings or sales, consider that its market cap is only $120 billion. Compared with the trillion-dollar-plus FAANG stocks, Alibaba at $725 billion, and Tencent at $844 billion, there is still plenty room for Sea Limited to appreciate in the years ahead."

During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings.

Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry.

            "Text": "Announcement of Periodic Review: Moody's announces completion of a periodic review of ratings of Alibaba Group Holding Limited\n\nGlobal Credit Research - 25 Jan 2021\n\nHong Kong, January 25, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service (\"Moody's\") has completed a periodic review of the ratings of Alibaba Group Holding Limited and other ratings that are associated with the same analytical unit. The review was conducted through a portfolio review discussion held on 19 January 2021 in which Moody's reassessed the appropriateness of the ratings in the context of the relevant principal methodology (ies), recent developments, and a comparison of the financial and operating profile to similarly rated peers. The review did not involve a rating committee. Since 1 January 2019, Moody's practice has been to issue a press release following each periodic review to announce its completion.\n\nThis publication does not announce a credit rating action and is not an indication of whether or not a credit rating action is likely in the near future. Credit ratings and outlook/review status cannot be changed in a portfolio review and hence are not impacted by this announcement. For any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.\n\nKey rating considerations are summarized below.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited's (Alibaba) A1 issuer rating reflects the fact that its integrated and diversified e-commerce platforms provide sustainable cost advantages, which allow the company to generate high profit margins and maintain strong credit quality.\n\nThe rating also takes into account Alibaba's 1) well-established brand name and leading market position in China's (A1) fast-growing e-commerce market; 2) its track record of monetization through fees from online marketing, services and subscriptions; and 3) transaction-based commissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, the rating also incorporates risks related to Alibaba's aspiration to continue to expand its business scope within and outside China. The rating also takes into account potential contingent liabilities associated with Ant Group Co., Ltd., in which Alibaba owns a 33% stake.\n\nThe rating also takes into consideration increased regulatory risk, as illustrated by a recent antitrust investigation by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). The investigation is credit negative and could limit Alibaba's revenue and earnings growth.\n\nThis document summarizes Moody's view as of the publication date and will not be updated until the next periodic review announcement, which will incorporate material changes in credit circumstances (if any) during the intervening period.\n\nThe principal methodology used for this review was Business and Consumer Service Industry published in October 2016. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.\n\nThis announcement applies only to EU rated, UK rated, EU endorsed and UK endorsed ratings. Non EU rated, non UK rated, non EU endorsed and non UK endorsed ratings may be referenced above to the extent necessary, if they are part of the same analytical unit.\n\nThis publication does not announce a credit rating action. For any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.\n\nLina Choi Senior Vice President Corporate Finance Group Moody's Investors Service Hong Kong Ltd. 24/F One Pacific Place 88 Queensway Hong Kong China (Hong Kong S.A.R.)

Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x.

He said he expects JD to out-compete offline rivals and to see strong growth in most of its key business segments.\n\nZhu gave a similar endorsement to JD rival Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), but only rated it market perform, showing he sees greater upside to JD.\n\nNow what\n\nAfter a blowout performance in 2020 that saw the stock jump 150%, the Chinese e-commerce company has gotten off to a strong start in 2021. It seems to have benefited from diminishing fears about a crackdown against Alibaba. The two companies often trade in tandem as they are subject to similar geopolitical risks.\n\nJD will have another opportunity to delight investors in the coming weeks as the Lunar New Year kicks off. Chinese e-commerce tends to spike around holidays like the New Year and Singles' Day in November, so the festivals are opportunities for the companies to show off their growth.\n\nJD's fourth-quarter earnings report is also due out in February. Analysts expect a 39% jump in revenue to $33.9 billion and for earnings per share to rise from $0.08 to $0.22, showing growth stock's margins are rapidly improving."

In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division.

The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial.

            "Headline": "What's Happening With Netflix?",
            "Text": "In this episode of MarketFoolery, host Chris Hill is joined by Motley Fool senior analyst Tim Beyers to discuss the latest earnings news. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) soars 14% higher after global subscriber growth comes in much higher than Wall Street was expecting. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) puts up strong quarterly numbers that fail to move the stock. Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) shares pop on a long-awaited sighting of founder Jack Ma. Tim analyzes those stories, and shares why U.S.-China relations are the key to chip maker ASML Holdings' (NASDAQ:ASML) year ahead.\n\nTo catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on January 20, 2021.\n\nChris Hill: It's Wednesday, January 20th. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today is our man in Colorado, Tim Beyers. Good to see you.\n\nTim Beyers: Good to see you too, Chris. How is it going?\n\nHill: It's going pretty well. We've got some tech equipment news. We've got consumer goods in the news, but we're going to start with the stock of the day, and that is Netflix. Fourth-quarter revenue came in a little higher than expected. Profits were on the light side, but Netflix added 8.5 million global subscribers. That's about 2 million more than Wall Street was expecting and shares up 14% today.\n\nBeyers: It's pretty impressive here. I think what we can say now officially is that in the streaming wars, Netflix is Coke [Coca-Cola], Disney+ is Pepsi [PepsiCo], everybody else can take a seat. I don't know who the RC Cola here is, Chris, but clearly, Netflix is the Coke. Just take a look at those 8.5 million subscribers. The thing that really stands out to me here, Chris, is that 83% of those subscribers are from overseas. This is something that really shouldn't surprise us, but I think does surprise the Street, because we think that Netflix is a U.S. company and they are. They do get a lot of their revenue and profit from the U.S., but they are increasingly seating programming around the world in foreign languages with local producers, local talent. But here's the other thing, it's really interesting. I haven't watched this yet, Chris, but I have a conspiracy theory about this. That part of the big jump here is The Queen's Gambit, and I've not seen it. I've not seen The Queen's Gambit. I have cheated and watched a lot of clips on YouTube, but apparently, this thing was massive in Russia because Russians like chess, and it was apparently a pretty big hit there. But I do think there's a lot of programming that hits here, and then it starts hitting in other territories, and The Queen's Gambit just continues to trend.\n\nHill: It is interesting, because what you just described is a scenario that we've seen play out previously with Netflix. We've certainly seen this play out with Disney+, and that is the idea that a big hit show that gets a lot of buzz is the kind of thing that can drive new subscribers. In the early days of Netflix, it wasn't an amazing advertising campaign that Netflix spent money on that got a lot of sign-ups. It was creating original programming that got a lot of attention and in the early days that was things like Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards, that sort of thing. So, maybe not a huge surprise that The Queen's Gambit is the latest version of that.\n\nBeyers: Yeah, and they were working on this pre-pandemic, obviously. We keep wondering when will be the time when Netflix spends big on something they expect to be a viral hit, and then it flops, and then Netflix is in trouble. I think that discounts the value of the business model, which is Ted Sarandos saying, \"I'm going to make 1,000 bets. I'm not going to make one big bet. I'm going to make 1,000 bets, and one of them is going to hit.\" I think that just keeps proving out over and over again, and this is why Netflix has now passed the 200 million subscriber threshold worldwide. That may be what's driving the gains here today as well. But Netflix, you underestimate this business to your peril.\n\nHill: I want to get to their guidance in just a second, but let me ask you about this, because this is something I've been thinking about over the past week or so. As the calendar flips to 2021 and we see more headlines of studios, particularly movie studios pushing back launch dates, release dates, that sort of thing, in part because they have to push back production schedules. If you go back to last spring, one of the big questions that Netflix in particular, others as well, Amazon Prime, Disney+, etc., they got this question too, but Netflix got it in a big way, which was essentially, \"If everything shuts down, what does that do for your content?\" Netflix and all the others said appropriately because it was the truth, \"Don't worry. We got plenty of stuff in the pipeline. We got stuff that is in the final stages of production, we're good.\" Well, that was 10 months ago.\n\nBeyers: Right.\n\nHill: I'm curious at what point should you and I feel any meaningful level of concern that this pandemic goes on and keeps productions shut down to the point where Netflix and others have to come out and say, \"You know what? From a programming standpoint, the cupboard is going to be a little bare in terms of new programming, simply because productions have been shut down.\"\n\nBeyers: Yeah, it's definitely something to look for, and we should be looking at Netflix's own promotion schedule. As they come out and they talk about new shows or they talk about new seasons, we should pay attention to that; however, and this is a big however, we have something here at The Motley Fool that we call Motley Fool Live. I think we've noticed that a lot of programming now is adjusting to this idea that, \"Hey, we can make programming everywhere and anywhere.\" Now, to be fair, a lot of that's appearing on YouTube, but let's not discount the creativity of Netflix and others to make programming that can incorporate actors, others working from their homes. Not last night, but the night before, I just watched a found-footage hit from a few years ago called Cloverfield. Which by the way, is an amazing movie, but found footage, that's a genre in film making. I don't think we can discount the creativity here either, Chris.\n\nHill: The last thing on Netflix. In terms of their guidance, they said, \"Starting next year, we're going to be cash flow positive.\" One of the things that's on the table for them in terms of capital allocation is stock buybacks, which is something they haven't done in a decade. 2011 was the last time Netflix was buying back stock. As a Netflix shareholder, are you excited about that, or do you look at stock buybacks and think to yourself, \"I really hope the company figures out a different way to spend money?\"\n\nBeyers: Yeah, I would like them to figure out a different way to spend money here, because Netflix is richly valued, we know that. Then, in addition, the other guidance they gave is cash-flow neutral, 2021, not raising new capital from here on out. That is outstanding news. If you don't need to raise new capital, and you're going to be cash-flow neutral, and then ultimately cash-flow positive, don't go spending that too soon. Look, you can go into the candy store, it doesn't mean you have to buy something. Let's just hold off a little bit, make that balance sheet a little bit stronger, because here's the thing, in these times, let's take your last point, Chris. You have some studios that can't make some certain projects, that's going to open up some projects for Netflix to bid on. You're better off if you can bid on those projects when your balance sheet is fat. Don't go spend it too soon, we need you to fatten that balance sheet.\n\nHill: The second-quarter revenue for Procter & Gamble rose 8%. The consumer goods giant also raised their outlook due to higher demand for their cleaning products, both home and personal grooming. But in terms of the stock, shares of Procter & Gamble are basically flat. I was a little surprised by that, because this is not a stock that has taken off over the past year. It's basically flat for the past year as well.\n\nBeyers: Yeah. Isn't this interesting, that when you look at these earnings -- and the blowout was meaningful, like, I'm looking at the adjusted earnings target that Wall Street was looking for, and it was $1.51 a share. Procter & Gamble came in at $1.64. That is meaningful. This is a COVID stock. We've been at home, we need more cleaning products, we're cooking at home. COVID is tailor-made for Procter & Gamble. I hate that that's true, because we all wish that COVID was gone, but it's funny to me that Procter & Gamble is not getting the tailwind here, because the results speak to just how necessary the Procter & Gamble product family is for those of us stuck at home with COVID. What's it going to take in order to drive the shares up here? I don't know. So, let's take your last point here, Chris. Maybe this is one where Procter & Gamble does have to get aggressive with buybacks, because if it's not going to move, where else do you put that capital?\n\nHill: I was thinking the same thing in part because we've seen, over the past four to six months, some of these consumer products giants exercise some pricing power. I look at P&G, on the face of it, this is a good quarter, but they're also pulling the levers you would want them to pull to move the stock higher. To your point, if what they've done so far isn't really moving the stock, then for a company like this, for a stock like this, then a buyback plan makes sense.\n\nBeyers: It might make some sense to maybe hike the dividend a little bit here, put some more into R&D, and maybe look at -- I'm not Ron Gross here, but I'll put my Ron Gross hat on here for a second, and maybe look at a tuck-in acquisition or two because there are some consumer brands that have really been hurt badly during the COVID crisis here. This is an opportunity maybe to broaden the portfolio a little bit.\n\nHill: Shares of Alibaba are up more than 5% because company founder Jack Ma has made his first public appearance in three months. I should point out, this is not an appearance that he made out in public, this was a video that he filmed tied to an event. But look, I think if you're an Alibaba shareholder over the last few months, wondering legitimately, \"Where's this guy been?\" If it were moving up dramatically more than that, I would think it was a little overblown. A 5% tick up seems right to me.\n\nBeyers: It does seem right to me too and can't we say, not to be too draconian about this, but aren't we just glad that it's not a hostage video?\n\nHill: [laughs] Yes.\n\nBeyers: Honestly.\n\nHill: For a number of reasons, we're glad.\n\nBeyers: For a number of reasons, because we were starting to worry that Jack Ma, something horrible had happened here, so he surfaced. It really is just a charity event. He's thanking teachers. It's nice. It's just a normal thing, and it wouldn't even be news if it weren't for the fact that he'd been missing for three months. Let's be clear, this does not mean that the scrutiny of Alibaba goes away, but he's the founder. The Chinese government did not like what he had to say a few months ago right before he went underground. The Chinese government has since said that they are going to pursue possibly some more strict regulatory oversight of Alibaba, and that could include breaking up different parts of the company. At the very least, they are taking some more strident action against Ant Financial, which is the payments part of Alibaba. The regulatory scrutiny doesn't go away. Sigh of relief to see Jack Ma is not completely out of the picture here.\n\nHill: We're going to stick, at least tangentially, with China on our final story, which is ASML Holdings. This is a company in the business of making chips, semiconductor chips, not the delicious kind. [laughs] Fourth-quarter profits and revenue for ASML came in higher than expected. But to go back to the guidance for a second, the company came out and was very clear that how they deal in 2021 has to do with the state of relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nBeyers: There's so much chip manufacturing that happens throughout Southeast Asia. The ultraviolet lithography equipment that ASML produces. This is a European-based company. Their equipment is highly sought after for manufacturing the most advanced types of chips. Their equipment is heavily in demand and the results show it. They absolutely blew the door off of results. I think what they're signaling here, Chris, is like, \"Hey, look. If you guys learn to cooperate, we can keep this up. If you can't learn to cooperate, please be aware that your mileage may vary if you hold our stock.\" First of all, I applaud them for being that transparent about it. Second of all, it's just a reminder that even though chip demand is very high, it's going to stay high for a really long period of time. If we don't have a thawing of relations between the U.S. and China, it's just going to get harder to watch the semiconductor market grow at the pace it's been growing. It'll be harder to keep that pace up.\n\nHill: I always like it when companies are direct with guidance. I've said before, if I were running a publicly traded company, I think I would be tempted to pull a Berkshire Hathaway and just say, \"No, here's the earnings report. We're not doing any guidance of any kind,\" and yet when companies are this transparent, I always applaud it.\n\nBeyers: I do too. What I like about this guidance is it's so much better than \"We expect to be between $0.13 and $0.15 a share,\" which is meaningless. Instead, what they're giving you is the metric to watch and say, \"Hey, there is a macroeconomic factor here.\" It's different to forecast that, and then come back and say, \"Hey, you know that macroeconomic factor we told you about? Here's what's happening there.\" We've seen this a million times, Chris, somebody comes out and says, \"Yeah, you know what, the weather patterns last quarter, they just weren't favorable to our business, and so shoppers decided not to come to our store.\" Really? Is that really the reason? Because I think it may have more to do with your products and less to do with the rain.\n\nHill: Well, and it goes back to something that we talk about all the time, which is when you're an investor and you're looking for guidance, it's not to say that there isn't value to be found or insights to be found from analysts' notes that come out from Wall Street firms. It is to say, however, that you should pay more attention to what is the guidance that the company itself is setting up, and in the case of ASML, they're very clearly saying, \"Look, this is what we're saying is going to move the needle for us.\"\n\nBeyers: I think that's fair to say. I think there are a lot of companies, honestly, that are looking for the same thing, they're just not saying it yet. But irrespective of that, right now, ASML has a very healthy business. They're absolutely killing it, and their product is very necessary for making the most advanced chips. There's going to be a lot more demand for this product. It's a better business if U.S.-China relations thaw a little bit, but it's still a great business even if they don't.\n\nHill: Tim Beyers, always good talking to you. Thanks for being here.\n\nBeyers: Thanks, Chris.\n\nHill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. That's going to do it for this edition of MarketFoolery. The show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening. We'll see you tomorrow."

Instead, the interest is mostly on momentum. For the most part, this approach has gotten… well… crazy! The phenomenon of Reddit investors has taken Wall Street by storm — and has even threatened the stability of billion-dollar hedge funds. These investors have targeted heavily shorted stocks to gin up epic squeezes. The result is that there have been huge surges with companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But whenever there is this level of speculation, the markets are likely close to reaching a peak. And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "Date": "2021-01-28",
            "Headline": "3 Chinese Tech Stocks I'd Buy Right Now",
            "Text": "I recently sold several of my Chinese tech stocks for regulatory, merger-related, and ethical reasons. Those divestments reduced the weight of Chinese stocks in my portfolio from about 20% to less than 10%.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm bearish on all Chinese tech stocks. The sector will remain challenging, due to regulatory threats in both the U.S. and China, but I believe three well-known Chinese stocks are still worth buying today: Bilibili (NASDAQ:BILI), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Let's find out a bit more about these tech companies.\n\n1. Bilibili\n\nBilibili is a diversified tech company that targets China's Gen Z users. Its gaming business, which generated 45% of its sales in the first nine months of 2020, licenses the hit game Fate/Grand Order from Sony's Aniplex and publishes other games like Cygames' Princess Connect.\n\nIts value-added services segment, which generates most of its revenue from live videos, accounted for 32% of its top line. Ads generated another 14% of its sales, and the remaining 9% mainly came from its e-commerce business, which sells tie-in products to video games and anime series.\n\nBilibili ties all these businesses together with a single ACG (anime, comics, and gaming) platform. The platform's monthly active users (MAUs) grew 54% year over year to 197.2 million in the third quarter, and its total number of paying users grew 89% to 15 million.\n\nBilibiil's revenue rose 71% year over year in the first nine months, led by the triple-digit percentage growth of its VAS and advertising segments, and analysts expect its revenue to rise 89% this year and another 47% next year. Bilibili isn't profitable yet, but it's already attracted big investments from Tencent and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which both consider it a valuable buffer against ByteDance's Gen Z-oriented apps.\n\nBilibili's stock already rallied nearly 480% over the past 12 months, but it still trades at 16 times next year's sales. That price-to-sales ratio isn't cheap, but it looks surprisingly reasonable in a market filled with stocks trading at over 40 times next year's sales.\n\n2. Baidu\n\nBaidu, which owns China's largest search engine, has traditionally been the weakest link of the BAT triumvirate, which includes Alibaba and Tencent. Its advertising business struggled as China's internet users spent more time on WeChat, ByteDance's Douyin (known as TikTok overseas), and other platforms.\n\nOn the surface, Baidu is still struggling. Its advertising revenue has declined year over year for six straight quarters, and its streaming video unit iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) -- which previously offset that slowdown -- also lost its momentum as users spent more time on short video apps.\n\nBut Baidu's declines are bottoming out. It expects its fourth-quarter revenue to rise 4% year over year, which indicates its advertising business has finally stabilized. Analysts expect Baidu's revenue to stay flat for the full year but rise 15% next year.\n\nThey also expect Baidu's focus on cutting costs, especially traffic acquisition costs for its main search engine, to lift its earnings 17% in fiscal 2020 and another 11% in 2021. We should always be skeptical of analysts' forecasts, but its ecosystem-expanding efforts -- including its Mini Programs, DuerOS voice assistant, AI services, Apollo driverless platform, and takeover of JOYY's YY Live -- could gradually diversify its core business away from ads.\n\nBaidu also doesn't face any antitrust headwinds even as regulators crack down on Alibaba and Tencent. Baidu's stock has already rallied more than 90% over the past 12 months as investors spotted those strengths, but it still trades at 26 times forward earnings and four times next year's sales.\n\n3. JD.com\n\nJD is China's largest direct retailer and second-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba. Unlike Alibaba -- which runs paid listing platforms, doesn't take on inventories, and fulfills orders with a logistics subsidiary -- JD takes on inventories and fulfills orders with its first-party logistics network. JD's business model is more capital-intensive than Alibaba's, but it shields shoppers from low-quality and counterfeit products.\n\nJD's revenue rose 28% year over year in the first nine months of 2020, and it ended the period with 441.6 million annual active shoppers, up 32% from a year ago. Most of that growth came from China's lower-tier cities, which brought in about 80% of its new shoppers during the third quarter.\n\nJD's margins have also been expanding, thanks to economies of scale and its infrastructure and logistics investments. Those investments throttled its earnings in previous years, but they're now reducing its infrastructure costs, lowering the costs of acquiring new shoppers, and helping it stay profitable. JD's decision to offer its logistics platform as a service to other companies is also raking in higher-margin revenue.\n\nThose tailwinds boosted its adjusted net income by 45% year over year in the first nine months of 2020. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 39% and 59%, respectively, for the full year. In fiscal 2021, they expect its revenue and earnings to increase another 23% and 38%, respectively -- which are solid growth rates for a stock that trades at 43 times forward earnings and just over one times next year's sales.\n\nThose valuations, along with Alibaba's antitrust troubles, indicate JD's stock could still have plenty of room to run after more than doubling in 2020."

            "Date": "2021-01-28",
            "Headline": "3 High-Growth Stocks That Are Still Dirt-Cheap",
            "Text": "Finding bargains in today's stock market isn't easy.\n\nCompany valuations have stretched across the board as the S&P 500 has jumped about 75% from its March nadir, and both hard-hit \"recovery stocks\" like Disney and Starbucks and pandemic winners like Etsy and Peloton are trading near all-time highs.\n\nMeanwhile, a bubble in areas like electric vehicles and renewable energy seems evident.\n\nStill, some stocks seem to have fallen out of fashion with investors and a few of them still have strong growth prospects. Keep reading to see three of the cheapest growth stocks on the market you can buy right now.\n\n1. Facebook\n\nSome of the best choices in investing are the obvious ones, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) offers a good example here.\n\nThe social media giant, which also owns Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus VR, has a powerful set of competitive advantages, including massive network effects, and what's essentially a duopoly in digital advertising with Alphabet's Google. The company's profit margins are among the best in the business world as it delivered a 38% operating margin in 2020 even as the company faced headwinds from the COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, its revenue growth remained strong, reaching 33% year over year in the fourth quarter as it overcame a boycott earlier from some of its biggest advertisers.\n\nThe company has faced plenty of criticism lately, including for subverting democracy, encouraging hate speech, being a monopoly, and banning former President Donald Trump. At the same time, its WhatsApp messaging app has experienced a backlash after Facebook changed its privacy policy, and it's also feuding with Apple over privacy issues.\n\nFacebook has long been something of a lightning rod for controversy, at least since Russian hacking of the site in the 2016 election and the subsequent Cambridge Analytica scandal occurred, but that hasn't stopped the growth of the business. Users rose by double-digit percentages in the fourth quarter to 3.3 billion monthly actives across all of its properties.\n\nBecause of the above concerns, Facebook is actually trading at a discount to the S&P 500 at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 27 based on 2020 earnings. That seems like a mistake, especially since growth is likely to accelerate in 2021 as the pandemic fades.\n\n2. Alibaba\n\nLike Facebook, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has been a magnet for controversy recently. After founder Jack Ma made insulting remarks to financial regulators at an October conference, the Chinese government has appeared to have the tech giant in its sights. First, the government blocked the IPO of Ant Group, Alibaba's former financial arm, and in December it opened up an antitrust investigation against Alibaba, sending the stock tumbling.\n\nEarlier this month, rumors swirled that Jack Ma was missing, though other reports said he was \"laying low\" to avoid public scrutiny. When he resurfaced on a videoconference call, Alibaba shares popped.\n\nInvestors seem to be exaggerating these risks here, however. First, Ma no longer holds a formal position in the company so his whereabouts or his standing with the Chinese government aren't as significant as they might seem. Secondly, Alibaba's own success is key to many of the things the government wants to accomplish, including being a technology leader, so it has no interest in severely damaging the company.\n\nAlibaba's business itself remains as strong as ever. The company operates the biggest e-commerce marketplace in the world with an annual gross merchandise volume of more than $1 trillion and has growth businesses in areas like cloud, logistics, and digital media.\n\nIn the quarter ended last September, revenue rose 30% to $22.8 billion, and adjusted net income jumped 44% year over year to $6.9 billion, giving the company the same kind of impressive margins as Facebook.\n\nDespite its robust growth and profitability, Alibaba is also cheaper than the average S&P 500 stock, trading at a P/E of just 28. While Chinese stocks do tend to trade at a discount because of regulatory concerns, Alibaba seems significantly undervalued even after accounting for that discrepancy.\n\n3. Vroom\n\nThe two stocks above are some of the biggest companies in the world, but there are also opportunities in smaller companies, which naturally offer more upside potential. Vroom (NASDAQ:VRM), an online used car dealer, offers one example as the company has missed out on the broader rally in e-commerce stocks during the pandemic.\n\nVroom shares popped on the company's IPO in June, but the stock price has actually fallen since then after the company disappointed in its two earnings reports. However, there's a good reason for that. Vroom scaled back on car purchasing during the lockdown period, so it was poorly prepared for the surge in demand that came later on as consumers bought cars to avoid public transportation and to address new needs during the crisis. That inventory imbalance weighed on results as overall revenue fell 3% in the second quarter and sales in its core e-commerce business rose 45%, down from triple-digit percentage growth in the first quarter, and those figures underwhelmed again in the third quarter. Its overall numbers include a dealership in Texas and a wholesale business, but investors should focus on the e-commerce segment.\n\nVroom's business should begin to normalize as it recovers from the inventory drought. Demand for used cars is expected to remain strong through 2021 as Americans continue to adjust to new lifestyles around remote work and other changes. Its e-commerce platform gives it an advantage during the pandemic, and its 2021 numbers should be strong as it laps the impact of the lockdowns in the crisis. Meanwhile, analysts expect revenue to surge 85% this year, and e-commerce is likely to grow faster than that.\n\nDespite those prospects, the stock still looks cheap, trading at a modest price-to-sales ratio of 2.5, which is less than its bigger rival Carvana or e-commerce kingpin Amazon. Vroom isn't yet profitable as the company is investing in its e-commerce platform, but gross margins are moving in the right direction, which is a positive sign. With Vroom's potential for triple-digit revenue growth in the coming quarters, growth stock investors shouldn't ignore this e-commerce disruptor."

And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "Text": "In this article, we discuss the 11 best quantum computing stocks to buy now. If you’re in a hurry click to skip ahead to the 5 Best Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nCBInsights defines quantum computing as the process of information that is represented by special quantum states. By tapping into quantum phenomena like “superposition” and “entanglement,” these machines handle information in a fundamentally different way to “classical” computers like smartphones, laptops, or even today’s most powerful supercomputers. Quantum computing has the power to solve critical computational problems across a wide array of services.\n\nQuantum computing has become viable for the growth of a business and society as a whole. In an study by MarketWatch, The Global Quantum Computing Market was valued at $89 million in 2016 and is projected to reach $949 million by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 30% from 2017 to 2025. In a separate study by McKinsey, there will be an estimated 2,000 to 5,000 quantum computers worldwide by 2030. Automotive will be one of the primary sectors for quantum computing with a high impact noticeable by around 2025 (see 12 Best Autonomous Vehicle Stocks to Buy For 2021.).\n\nQuantum computing isn't a theoretical subject anymore. \"Today, real quantum processors are used by researchers from all over the world to test out algorithms for applications in a variety of fields. But it was only a few decades ago that quantum computing was a purely theoretical subject.\" IBM said about this. During the COVID-19 pandemic, pressures on finding a solution to seamless communication and data transfer has prompt the way for quantum computing. The industry had provided solutions where there are no identifiable trends and solved problems outside existing supercomputing capabilities.\n\nBest Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now\n\nCredit: IBM\n\nAlthough most quantum computing companies are not pure-play, investing in these stocks will provide potential capital grains by buying and holding a stock while watching the industry grow. The long-term possibility of bringing such tech to the market will post a good return.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, some of the biggest tech giants are working on the technology to bring QC on areas such as logistics, military affairs, pharmaceuticals, aerospace, utilities, AI, and especially digital manufacturing. According to Nasdaq, the productivity gains by end-users of quantum computing, in the form of both cost savings and revenue opportunities, are expected to surpass $450 billion annually. Based on a report by BCG value in the industry will increase rapidly as the technology and its commercial viability mature\n\n“It will be a slow build for the next few years: we anticipate value for end users in these sectors to reach a relatively modest $2 billion to $5 billion by 2024. But value will then increase rapidly as the technology and its commercial viability mature,”\n\nThe race for quantum dominance heats up. Recently, IBM (IBM) announced their plan to build a 1,000-qubit quantum computer by 2023. This will pave way for a revolution in computing. IBM's vice president of quantum research, Jay Gambetta, said in a release.\n\n\"We think of IBM Quantum Condor as an inflection point, a milestone that marks our ability to implement error correction and scale up our devices, while simultaneously complex enough to explore potential quantum advantages — problems that we can solve more efficiently on a quantum computer than on the world's best supercomputers,\"\n\nIn order to identify the 11 best quantum computing stocks to buy now, we started out with Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM)'s holdings and ranked them using our hedge fund sentiment scores. Our in-house analysis shows that we can use the sentiment information gathered from the hedge fund filings to classify in advance a select group of stocks that can beat the S&P 500 index by double digits annually on average. For instance, the portfolio of our monthly newsletter’s stock picks has beaten the market by over 88 percentage points since March 2017 (see details here) Some of the portfolio holdings of our monthly newsletter have been shared publicly too. In October, we shared this real estate stock and since then, it’s been up more than 50 percent.\n\nBased on our hedge fund sentiment data, we now present to you the 11 best quantum computing stocks to buy now based on the stock picks of 800+ hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey:\n\n11. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT)\n\nNo of HFs: 59\n\nTotal Value of HF Holdings: $2.49 Billion\n\nWe start the list of best quantum computing stocks with AMAT. The company is known for their engineering solutions used to produce virtually every new chip and advanced display in the world. Heading into the fourth quarter of 2020, a total of 59 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of 2% from one quarter earlier. By comparison, 55 hedge funds held shares or bullish call options in AMAT a year ago.\n\nAmong these funds, Generation Investment Management held the most valuable stake in Applied Materials, Inc.

Pat Gelsinger, Intel’s incoming CEO said,\n\n“I am pleased with the progress made on the health and recovery of the 7-nanometer program. I am confident that the majority of our 2023 products will be manufactured internally. At the same time, given the breadth of our portfolio, it’s likely that we will expand our use of external foundries for certain technologies and products.”\n\n9. Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg Co Ltd (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNo of HFs: 67\n\nTotal Value of HF Holdings: $7.97 Billion\n\nTSM ranks 9th in our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy now.

In First Eagle Investment Management’s Q3 2020 investor letter they mentioned a few of their comments in the stock.\n\n“Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) traded higher during the quarter on signs that its total addressable market was poised to expand. Intel announced that it was facing delays in the manufacture of its next-generation chips and may contract out the work to third parties, opening the door for a large-scale chip “foundry” like TSMC to pick up some of the business. Foundries make chips designed and named by other companies; TSMC already produces certain chips for Intel.”\n\n8. NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI)\n\nNo of HFs: 68\n\nTotal Value of HF Holdings: $1.63 Billion\n\nNXPI is the 8th best quantum computing stock to buy now according to hedge funds.

Torsten Lehmann, EVP, and GM, Radio Frequency Processing of NXP said the radar sensor solutions can help users cover NCAP requirements.\n\n“Radar has evolved from just detecting other cars’ velocity and distance to providing imaging radar’s high-resolution object and feature detection for precisely mapping the car’s surroundings. Our new radar sensor solutions can help customers cover NCAP requirements to make driving safe, and also address the frontier of ADAS sensing on the path towards fully autonomous vehicles.”\n\n7. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNo of HFs: 71\n\nTotal Value of HF Holdings: $5.08 Billion\n\nAMD ranks 7th in our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. At the end of the third quarter, a total of 71 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 39% from one quarter earlier. In an article, Carillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund mentioned that AMD outperformed due to healthy growth in the personal computer and data center server markets\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices produces semiconductor products and devices. The stock outperformed due to healthy growth in the personal computer and data center server markets. The company also continues to gain share against its major competitor, which is having significant issues in its next generation products. Furthermore, investors have appreciated the margins and profitability the company has been posting in addition to the topline strength.”\n\n6. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nNo of HFs: 79\n\nTotal Value of HF Holdings: $4.57 Billion\n\nMicron ranks 6th in our list of the best quantum computing stocks to buy now. At Q3’s end, a total of 79 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -6% from one quarter earlier. Being a producer of computer memory and computer data storage, Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU) is dubbed to be one of the largest makers of DRAM and NAND memory chips globally and supplies memory chips to other businesses that need it for their products.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Mark Tepper of Strategic Wealth Partners said, “I’ll be holding Micron.”. He mentioned that there’s always a supply and demand narrative over this type of company. “Their product is the ‘input’ to technology and not technology itself.” Mark added that he rather own the ‘technology’ than having only the raw product.\n\nMeanwhile, MKM Partners’ JC O’Hara said, Micron has plenty of room to run upwards. He emphasized that the recent breakout of Micron after a long period of consolidation is a ‘very powerful bull run’. “Technically, we see the stock to push higher to $85 in the near term and that gives you another 10% from the current levels.”. He concluded that investors must stay in touch with Micron’s management when it reports earnings on Jan. 7, because this could either be a potential catalyst or risk factor for the stock.\n\nBonsai Partners also mentioned MU in their Q3 2020 investor letter.\n\nIf there’s one investment mistake I’ve made multiple times in my career it’s accepting lower quality businesses available at attractive prices. I hope I’m not repeating this mistake again with Micron. Acquiring a low-quality business at a great price usually does not lead to great investment returns, but neither does a great business at a low-quality price. You have to have both to earn superior returns. I view Micron’s share price is quite attractive, but I also believe the business is transitioning from being mediocre to rather good. If that happens, attractive returns should follow. Historically, Micron has not been kind to shareholders, and its shares are currently priced to reflect this. However, I believe that the nature of the DRAM industry has structurally changed for the better. From a high-level, what makes Micron attractive is how essential it is to human progress. Without getting too professorial, humanity has had multiple waves of productivity gains over the past 12,000 years. The first big improvement in productivity came from the agricultural revolution, which allowed humans to shift from hunting and gathering into high productivity farming and the division of labor. The second wave of human productivity came from the industrial revolution, which harnessed machines to perform repetitive tasks on our behalf. We are now in the third wave of human productivity: the information age. Like the machines of the industrial revolution, silicon chips are now automating and simplifying information-driven tasks. Each of these waves relied on certain enabling resources; those that had them thrived, and those that did not fell behind. In the agricultural revolution, the enabling resources were arable land and nutrient-rich grains. In the industrial revolution, it was fossil fuels. And in the information revolution, it is silicon chips. If you’re wondering why the United States government recently imposed restrictions on Chinese use of U.S. semiconductor technology (such as in the case of Huawei) – this action is like taking control of the world’s oil fields during the industrial revolution. It’s a way to keep China in check and maintain dominance of the global economy.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nSuggested article:\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Buy Now is originally published at Insider Monkey."

Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability.

The phenomenon of Reddit investors has taken Wall Street by storm — and has even threatened the stability of billion-dollar hedge funds. These investors have targeted heavily shorted stocks to gin up epic squeezes. The result is that there have been huge surges with companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But whenever there is this level of speculation, the markets are likely close to reaching a peak. And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nLet’s talk portfolio defense. After last week’s social flash mob market manipulation, that’s a topic that should not be ignored. Now, this is not to say that the markets are collapsing. After 2% losses to close out last week’s Friday session, this week’s trading kicked off with a positive tone, as the S&P 500 rose 1.5% and the Nasdaq climbed 2.5%. The underlying bullish factors – a more stable political scene, steadily progressing COVID vaccination programs – are still in play, even if they are not quite as strong as investors had hoped. While increased volatility could stay with us for a while, it’s time to consider defensive stocks. And that will bring us to dividends. By providing a steady income stream, no matter what the market conditions, a reliable dividend stock provides a pad for your investment portfolio when the share stop appreciating. With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up three dividend stocks yielding 8%. That’s not all they offer, however. Each of these stocks has scored enough praise from the Street to earn a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. New Residential Investment (NRZ) We’ll start by looking into the REIT sector, real estate investment trusts. These companies have long been known for dividends that are both high-yield and reliable – as a result of company compliance with tax rules, that require REITs to return a certain percentage of profits directly to shareholders. NRZ, a mid-size company with a market cap of $3.9 billion, holds a diverse portfolio of residential mortgages, original loans, and mortgage loan servicing rights. The company is based in New York City. NRZ holds a $20 billion investment portfolio, which has yielded $3.4 billion in dividends since the company’s inception. The portfolio has proven resilient in the face of the corona crisis, and after a difficult first quarter last year, NRZ saw rising gains in Q2 and Q3. The third quarter, the last reported, showed GAAP income of $77 million, or 19 cents per share. While down year-over-year, this EPS was a strong turnaround from the 21-cent loss reported in the prior quarter. The rising income has put NRZ in a position to increase the dividend. The Q3 payment was 15 cents per common share; the Q4 dividend was bumped up to 20 cents per common share. At this rate, the dividend annualizes to 80 cents and yields an impressive 8.5%. In another move to return profits to investors, the company announced in November that it had approved $100 million in stock repurchases. BTIG analyst Eric Hagen is impressed with New Residential – especially by the company’s sound balance sheet and liquidity. “[We] like the opportunity to potentially build some capital through retained earnings while maintaining a competitive payout. We think the dividend increase highlights the strengthening liquidity position the company sees itself having right now… we expect NRZ has been able to release capital as it's sourced roughly $1 billion of securitized debt for its MSR portfolio through two separate deals since September,” Hagen opined. In line with his comments, Hagen rates NRZ a Buy, and his $11 price target implies an upside of 17% for the year ahead. (To watch Hagen’s track record, click here) It’s not often that the analysts all agree on a stock, so when it does happen, take note. NRZ’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 7 Buys. The stock’s $11.25 average price target suggests ~20% upside from the current share price of $9.44. (See NRZ stock analysis on TipRanks) Saratoga Investment Corporation (SAR) With the next stock, we move to the investment management sector. Saratoga specializes in mid-market debt, appreciation, and equity investments, and holds over $546 million in assets under management. Saratoga’s portfolio is wide ranging, and includes industrials, software, waste disposal, and home security, among others. Saratoga saw a slow – but steady – rebound from the corona crisis. The company’s revenues fell in 1Q20, and have been slowly increasing since. The fiscal Q3 report, released early in January, showed $14.3 million at the top line. In pre-tax adjusted terms, Saratoga’s net investment income of 50 cents per share beat the 47-cent forecast by 6%. They say that slow and steady wins the race, and Saratoga has shown investors a generally steady hand over the past year. The stock has rebounded 163% from its post-corona crash low last March. And the dividend, which the company cut back in CYQ2, has been raised twice since then. The current dividend, at 42 cents per common share, was declared last month for payment on February 10. The annualized payment of $1.68 gives a yield of 8.1%. Analyst Mickey Schleien, of Ladenburg Thalmann, takes a bullish view of Saratoga, writing, “We believe SAR's portfolio is relatively defensive with a focus on software, IT services, education services, and the CLO... SAR's CLO continues to be current and performing, and the company is seeking to refinance/upsize it which we believe could provide upside to our forecast.\" The analyst continued, \"Our model anticipates SAR employing cash and SBA debentures to fund net portfolio growth. We believe the Board will continue to increase the dividend considering the portfolio's performance, the existence of undistributed taxable income, and the economic benefit of the Covid-19 vaccination program.” To this end, Schleien rates SAR a Buy along with a $25 price target. This figure implies a 20% upside from current levels. (To watch Schleien’s track record, click here) Wall Street’s analysts agree with Schleien on this stock – the 3 other reviews on record are Buys, and the analyst consensus rating is a Strong Buy. Saratoga’s shares are trading for $20.87, and carry an average price target of $25.50, suggesting an upside of 22% for the next 12 months. (See SAR stock analysis on TipRanks) Hercules Capital (HTGC) Last but not least is Hercules Capital, a venture capital company. Hercules offers financing support to small, early-stage client companies with scientific bent; Hercules’ clients are in life sciences, technology, and financial SaaS. Since getting started in 2003, Hercules has invested over $11 billion in more than 500 companies. The quality of Hercules’ portfolio is clear from the company’s recent performance. The stock has bounced back fully from the corona crisis of last winter, rebounding 140% from its low point reached last April. Earnings have also recovered; for the first nine months of 2020, HTGC posted net investment income of $115 million, or 11% higher than the same period of 2019. For dividend investors, the key point here is that the net investment income covered the distribution – in fact, it totaled 106% of the base distribution payout. The company was confident enough to boost the distribution with a 2-cent supplemental payment. The combined payout gives a $1.28 annualized payment per common share, and a yield of 8.7%. In another sign of confidence, Hercules completed a $100 million investment grade bond offering in November, raising capital for debt pay-downs, new investments, and corporate purposes. The bonds were offered in two tranches, each of $50 million, and the notes are due in March of 2026. Covering the stock for Piper Sandler, analyst Crispin Love sees plenty to love in HTGC. “We continue to believe that HTGC's focus on fast growing technology and life sciences companies sets the company up well in the current environment. In addition, Hercules is not dependent on a COVID recovery as it does not have investments in \"at-risk\" sectors. Hercules also has a strong liquidity position, which should allow the company to act quickly when it finds attractive investment opportunities,” Love commented. All of the above convinced Love to rate HTGC an Outperform (i.e. Buy). In addition to the call, he set a $16 price target, suggesting 9% upside potential. (To watch Love’s track record, click here) Recent share appreciation has pushed Hercules’ stock right up to the average price target of $15.21, leaving just ~4% upside from the trading price of $14.67. Wall Street doesn’t seem to mind, however, as the analyst consensus rating is a unanimous Strong Buy, based on 6 recent Buy-side reviews.

The company’s revenues fell in 1Q20, and have been slowly increasing since. The fiscal Q3 report, released early in January, showed $14.3 million at the top line. In pre-tax adjusted terms, Saratoga’s net investment income of 50 cents per share beat the 47-cent forecast by 6%. They say that slow and steady wins the race, and Saratoga has shown investors a generally steady hand over the past year. The stock has rebounded 163% from its post-corona crash low last March. And the dividend, which the company cut back in CYQ2, has been raised twice since then. The current dividend, at 42 cents per common share, was declared last month for payment on February 10. The annualized payment of $1.68 gives a yield of 8.1%. Analyst Mickey Schleien, of Ladenburg Thalmann, takes a bullish view of Saratoga, writing, “We believe SAR's portfolio is relatively defensive with a focus on software, IT services, education services, and the CLO... SAR's CLO continues to be current and performing, and the company is seeking to refinance/upsize it which we believe could provide upside to our forecast.\" The analyst continued, \"Our model anticipates SAR employing cash and SBA debentures to fund net portfolio growth. We believe the Board will continue to increase the dividend considering the portfolio's performance, the existence of undistributed taxable income, and the economic benefit of the Covid-19 vaccination program.” To this end, Schleien rates SAR a Buy along with a $25 price target. This figure implies a 20% upside from current levels. (To watch Schleien’s track record, click here) Wall Street’s analysts agree with Schleien on this stock – the 3 other reviews on record are Buys, and the analyst consensus rating is a Strong Buy. Saratoga’s shares are trading for $20.87, and carry an average price target of $25.50, suggesting an upside of 22% for the next 12 months. (See SAR stock analysis on TipRanks) Hercules Capital (HTGC) Last but not least is Hercules Capital, a venture capital company. Hercules offers financing support to small, early-stage client companies with scientific bent; Hercules’ clients are in life sciences, technology, and financial SaaS. Since getting started in 2003, Hercules has invested over $11 billion in more than 500 companies. The quality of Hercules’ portfolio is clear from the company’s recent performance. The stock has bounced back fully from the corona crisis of last winter, rebounding 140% from its low point reached last April. Earnings have also recovered; for the first nine months of 2020, HTGC posted net investment income of $115 million, or 11% higher than the same period of 2019. For dividend investors, the key point here is that the net investment income covered the distribution – in fact, it totaled 106% of the base distribution payout. The company was confident enough to boost the distribution with a 2-cent supplemental payment. The combined payout gives a $1.28 annualized payment per common share, and a yield of 8.7%. In another sign of confidence, Hercules completed a $100 million investment grade bond offering in November, raising capital for debt pay-downs, new investments, and corporate purposes. The bonds were offered in two tranches, each of $50 million, and the notes are due in March of 2026. Covering the stock for Piper Sandler, analyst Crispin Love sees plenty to love in HTGC. “We continue to believe that HTGC's focus on fast growing technology and life sciences companies sets the company up well in the current environment. In addition, Hercules is not dependent on a COVID recovery as it does not have investments in \"at-risk\" sectors. Hercules also has a strong liquidity position, which should allow the company to act quickly when it finds attractive investment opportunities,” Love commented. All of the above convinced Love to rate HTGC an Outperform (i.e. Buy). In addition to the call, he set a $16 price target, suggesting 9% upside potential. (To watch Love’s track record, click here) Recent share appreciation has pushed Hercules’ stock right up to the average price target of $15.21, leaving just ~4% upside from the trading price of $14.67. Wall Street doesn’t seem to mind, however, as the analyst consensus rating is a unanimous Strong Buy, based on 6 recent Buy-side reviews.

            "Text": "InvestorPlace\n\nNowadays it’s not really popular to focus stocks selling at a discount — that is, the so-called value investing approach. Instead, the interest is mostly on momentum. For the most part, this approach has gotten… well… crazy! The phenomenon of Reddit investors has taken Wall Street by storm — and has even threatened the stability of billion-dollar hedge funds. These investors have targeted heavily shorted stocks to gin up epic squeezes. The result is that there have been huge surges with companies like GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), Koss (NASDAQ:KOSS) and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips But whenever there is this level of speculation, the markets are likely close to reaching a peak. And if this is the case this time, investors may want to look at value plays. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends So then which ones looking interesting right now? Well, let’s take a look at seven otherwise familiar names: IBM (NYSE:IBM) Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) Ameriprise Financial (NYSE:AMP) Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Stocks Selling at a Discount: IBM (IBM) Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com The past few years have seen strong gains from old-tech companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). But some have been left behind. One is IBM. IBM stock touched a $180 high in February 2017 and hasn’t been anywhere close in the intervening four years. Shares are trading for under $120 a piece, bringing the current market capitalization to about $106 billion. The main reason for this? It’s really simple: Revenues have been declining. In fact, the latest earnings report was yet another case of this, with revenues off about 6% to $20.4 billion. OK, in light of this, why might it be a good idea for investors to consider IBM stock? There are several reasons. First of all, IBM plans to spin-off its managed-infrastructure services business, which should help streamline operations. Next, the company has been making bold acquisitions — such as for Red Hat — to reinvigorate its technology product line. Then there is the R&D capability. The company has been investing heavily in key areas like artificial intelligence (AI), the hybrid cloud and quantum computing. As for IBM stock, it is selling at a reasonable valuation. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is at 10.8x. The dividend yield is also 5.43%, which is one of the highest in the tech industry. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Since late October, Morgan Stanley has been in the rally mode. The shares have gone from $48 to $68. Yet MS stock is still trading at a discounted valuation. Consider that the forward price-earnings ratio is only about 12.08x. This is reasonable in light of the potential growth opportunities. With interest rates at rock-bottom levels and the booming market for IPOs and SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies), the environment is quite favorable. During the latest quarter, earnings jumped by 51% to $3.39 billion, or $1.81 per share and revenues were up by 26% to $13.64 billion. There was strength across all the company’s businesses. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times However, the biggest bright spot was the investment banking division. The revenues soared by 46% to $2.30 billion. About $1 billon came from equity offerings. True, IPOs can be choppy. But for the most part, the momentum is particularly strong — and this should be a nice source of growth in the new year. Morgan Stanley has also been aggressive with M&A. To this end, the company acquired E*TRADE and Eaton Vance. There will not only be cost synergies, but also boosts of the top line. The company is also ramping up its buybacks for MS stock. The most recent authorization is for up to $10 billion. Oracle (ORCL) Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com Oracle has been a laggard in its move to the cloud, which has certainly been a drag on ORCL stock. But during the past few years, the company has been transitioning its various platforms. And yes, this should be key to get Oracle back on the growth path. The components for the cloud story include NetSuite, which is a fast-growing ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, Fusion (middleware technologies) and Gen2 (for infrastructure). These platforms have been seeing nice growth ramps — and have good long-term prospects. Then what about the core database business? Yes, this has come under pressure from upstarts like MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB). But Oracle has been making considerable progress. At the heart of this is the Autonomous Database. Oracle CTO and cofounder, Larry Ellison, told the latest earnings call: “it is certainly cloud first. It is the only database that really does both transaction processing and query processing. So query processing were much faster than Snowflake, the market’s current darling. And in transaction processing, we’re much faster than anybody.” Meanwhile, ORCL stock is trading at a cheap valuation — at least compared to other tech operators — with the forward price-to-earnings multiple at 14x. The dividend yield is also an acceptable 1.657%. Ameriprise Financial (AMP) Source: Shutterstock Revenues for financial advisory operators are projected to go from $57 billion to $200 billion in the next decade. One driver for this is the digitization of the industry. But then there is the impact of the Baby Boom generation, which has a population of 75 million. This group will demand more services to help with retirement needs (such as finding ways to live off their current assets). Such trends are definitely good news for Ameriprise Financial. The company is one of the largest financial advisory firms. It has over $900 billion in assets under management and has more than two million clients. The Top 7 Hot Stocks to Buy for 2021’s Biggest Trends Ameriprise Financial is also a highly disciplined organization. During the past eight years, earnings per share have nearly tripled and the company has returned a hefty $15 billion back to shareholders. AMP stock is also selling at a discount, with the forward PE at 11x. As for the dividend, it is at 2.1%. Cisco Systems (CSCO) Source: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com Last year, investors saw Cisco Systems shares decline about 6% while the S&P 500 index gained more than 18%. Then again, the growth sputtered as competition heated up and there were delays because of the Covid-19 pandemic. But as for the new year, things are likely to be better for CSCO stock. Analysts expect continued improvement in the operations after the company beat the consensus estimates in the fiscal first quarter. The company has been making a shift towards software and recurring subscription business models. Q2 results are due on Feb. 9. Although, the WebEx videoconference business could be the biggest driver. Cisco has been making considerable updates to the platform, which should help boost growth. Some of the new features include real-time language translation, speech enhancement, and transcriptions. Regarding the valuation of Cisco, it is at relatively low levels at least for big tech operators. The forward price-to-earnings multiple is 14.3x and the dividend yield is 3.2%. Verizon Communications (VZ) Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com The consumer mobile phone business in the U.S. is fairly saturated. But it is still a great source of cash flows. Just look at Verizon. During the first nine months of last year, cash flows came to $32.5 billion, up from $26.7 billion in the same period in 2019. There are currently about 94.1 million subscribers. But in the coming years, Verizon is poised to get a boost from its 5G network. And this will be more than just about consumer offerings. If anything, the opportunity for business customers may be even bigger. A key will be the development of edge network systems to allow for Internet of Thing (IoT) applications, such as on the factory floor. 7 Safe Stocks to Buy for Solid Returns in Tumultuous Times The valuation on VZ stock is also at discounted levels. The forward price-to-earnings ratio is 10.88x and the dividend yield is 4.6%. Moreover, the company has increased the payout for 13 consecutive years. Lockheed Martin (LMT) Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com With the new Biden Administration, there will likely be more pressure on the defense budget. Another factor is the escalating budget deficits. However, for the large defense contractors, there will likely be continued growth — especially since there remain considerable national security risks to address. So one company that looks attractive is Lockheed Martin, which has the advantage of massive scale. Consider that it is the largest defense contractor in the U.S. During the latest quarter, revenues increased by 7.3% to $17.03 billion and earnings were up by 20.6% to $6.38 per share. The big source of business is the massive F-35 program. But there are other important drivers as well. In fact, the company recently acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.4 billion. The company is a developer of hypersonic technology, which is essential for missile and space systems. Regarding LMT stock, the valuation is at a reasonable 12.2x times forward earnings. The dividend yield is also at 3.3%. On the date of publication, Tom Taulli did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

When we last looked at BABA on Nov. 4 we wrote that, \"The charts of BABA tell me that the risks of ownership have gone up. Stops should be raised to $279 from a close below $260. With the entire world seeming to be in flux now we could see another 'shoe drop' on BABA at any time -- probably while our markets are closed.\"\n\nThe Point and Figure chart showed a downside price target \"in the $245 area\" at the time but prices fell still further and broke below the 200-day moving average line.\n\nHow do the charts look now? Let's check.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of BABA, below, we can see that the shares plunged to near $210 in late December followed by a rebound in January taking BABA back above the 200-day average line and the 50-day moving average line. The trading volume was very heavy at the late December low as some traders may have been dumping long positions as support from July and August was broken.

(BABA), the Chinese e-commerce giant that's successfully expanding amid the COVID-19 pandemic, has found itself in the crosshairs of China's market watchdog. The Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation has launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba, mirroring the antirust investigations U.S. regulators have launched against big American tech firms Facebook Inc. (FB) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL).﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nInvestors will be watching to see how Alibaba is dealing with the China antitrust probe, and also whether the company can maintain its robust growth when it reports earnings on February 2, 2021 for Q3 FY 2021.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Alibaba's fiscal year (FY) ends in March. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per American Depositary Share (ADS) and revenue to post healthy gains compared to the year-ago quarter.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nInvestors also will focus on Alibaba's annual active consumers in China, also called \"active buyers.\" This key metric is used to gauge the number of users making purchases on its platform. Analysts expect annual active consumers in China to grow, but at a slower rate than in recent years.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nShares of Alibaba have outperformed the broader market over the past year. But that performance has been volatile. After reaching a recent peak in late October in anticipation of a public listing of Alibaba's financial-technology affiliate, Ant Group Co.

            "Text": "Alibaba stock has rallied off lows and is holding above its 10-week moving average. But with earnings due Tuesday before the open, is BABA stock a buy right now?\n\nX\n\nThe Zacks consensus estimate is for adjusted profit of $3.11 a share up 19% year-over-year, with sales up 40% to $32.52 billion.\n\nSellers were in Alibaba stock on Nov. 3 after the $34.5 billion Ant Group IPO was suspended in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The decision to suspend the IPO came after Shanghai exchange officials said it would halt the listing due to the company's inability to fulfill conditions amid changes in the regulatory environment.\n\nSellers were in Alibaba stock again on Nov. 5 after the company reported earnings and missed on sales.\n\nBABA stock crashed another 8% on Nov. 10 after Chinese regulators announced new draft antimonopoly rules for China online platforms like Alibaba and JD.com (JD), among others. It's had a hard time attracting buyers since then.\n\nAlibaba stock sold off sharply on Dec. 24 on news the Chinese government launched an anti-monopoly probe into the e-commerce giant. But shares rallied sharply on Dec. 29 on news progress is being made to overhaul the operations of Ant Group into a financial holding company. Ant Group is the fintech arm of Alibaba (BABA) Ant Group operates a suite of financial products, including the widely used Alipay digital wallet in China.\n\nAlibaba Stock Fundamental Analysis\n\nWhen it comes to liquid, megacap stocks in China, it's hard to find a more compelling name in terms of fundamentals than Alibaba. The stock has been a big winner since its IPO in September 2014.\n\nExpectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November, and the company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.\n\nThe company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.\n\nAlibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba's cloud-computing business is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business.\n\nAlibaba also sees dollar signs in food delivery. In 2018, it merged its food delivery service Ele.me with its lifestyle app Koubei to better compete with Tencent (TCEHY)-owned Meituan.\n\nSales at Alibaba's digital media and entertainment unit are also rising. The unit includes Alibaba's videostreaming platform Youku, along with its music streaming service, Xiami. Alibaba also has a licensing agreement with Walt Disney (DIS) unit Buena Vista International, giving it access to a large amount of Disney content.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze actionable stocks in the coronavirus stock market rally on IBD Live\n\nAnd just like Amazon, Alibaba sees potential in the sports streaming market. In 2018, the company partnered with China Central Television and streamed all matches of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Alibaba said the World Cup, as well as continued investment in original content, fueled daily average subscriber growth of 200% for Youku.\n\nTop-Rated Stock\n\nAlibaba's Composite Rating of 89 (scale of 1-99 with 99 being the best) is helped by strong earnings and sales growth in recent quarters along with excellent 12-month price performance.\n\nFor a megacap stock, Alibaba continues to deliver torrid growth. But earnings and sales growth slowed dramatically in May, hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. Adjusted profit inched up 2% year over year to $1.30 a share. But that was well above the consensus estimate of 85 cents. Revenue increased 16% to just over $16.14 billion, also above expectations of $15.1 billion.\n\nThe company on August 20 reported a 15% rise in quarterly profit. Sales increased 30% to $21.76 billion.\n\nAlibaba breaks down its revenue into four segments: Core Commerce, Cloud Computing, Digital Media and Entertainment and Innovation Initiatives. Core commerce revenue jumped 34% to $18.9 billion. Cloud computing revenue increased 59% to $1.75 billion, accounting for the lion's share of total revenue.\n\nMobile monthly active users totaled 874 million, up 15.8% from the year-ago quarter and 3.3% sequentially.\n\nTop Fundamentals\n\nAnnual return on equity of 21% and pretax margin of 31.3% help its top-notch SMR Rating (sales + margins + return on equity) of A from IBD Stock Checkup.

Alibaba, a member of IBD's Long-Term Leaders portfolio, soared out of a 24-week consolidation in July.\n\nA 36% pullback for Alibaba stock in the second half of 2018 shook out a lot of sellers in the stock and ultimately served to reset the base count.\n\nAlibaba broke out of a flat base with a 268.10 buy point during the week ended Aug. 28. It rallied for a bit, then started to pull back with the broad market. A new flat base formed with a 299.10 buy point, although an early entry was seen when Alibaba stock gapped up on Sept. 30.\n\nImproving RS Line\n\nAlibaba's relative strength line is starting to point higher after a nice rally off lows. A stock's relative strength line, found in daily and weekly charts at investors.com, compares the stock's daily price performance to the S&P 500. An upward-sloping RS line means the stock is outperforming the S&P 500. A downward-sloping line means the stock is lagging the S&P 500.\n\nThe bottom line: With Alibaba stock still far off its high, it still has overhead supply to work through. But aggressive investors might opt to buy if BABA stock gaps up on earnings. If it does, watch for Alibaba to hold gains. Sometimes, stocks gap up on earning but aren't able to hold gains. Look at what Skyworks (SWKS) did on Jan. 29.\n\nRisk averse investors will wait and see if Alibaba can fully form the right side of a base. If it does, a breakout to new highs isn't out of the question.\n\nFollow Ken Shreve on Twitter at @IBD_KShreve for more market insight and analysis\n\nYOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:\n\nBest China Stocks To Buy And Watch\n\nIBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists—\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

Let's look at the charts ahead of earnings.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) - Get Report shares were rallying on Monday, up about 2.5% with earnings due up on Tuesday before the stock market opens.\n\nA few months ago, bulls were eagerly gobbling up the stock. Now? Not so much, save for the pre-earnings bump.\n\nA lot has happened in the last few months, sending shares of Alibaba spiraling lower. While the stock has recovered from the lows, investors will be seeking plenty of reassurances from management.\n\nThe stock took a big hit when the Ant's initial public offering was shelved in China over regulatory concerns.\n\nThen there worries about founder Jack Ma, Alibaba’s possible monopolistic operations and concerns over being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThrow it all together and this cocktail of negative news had Alibaba fall 34% from peak to trough in about two months. With Monday’s rise, shares are still down about 20% from the highs.\n\nTrading Alibaba\n\nDaily chart of Alibaba stock. Chart courtesy of TrendSpider.com\n\nOn Dec. 24, Alibaba stock dipped to a low of $211. There it found immediate support, as the 100-week moving average and prior high from 2018 stepped in and buoyed the share price.\n\nThe stock has recovered nicely since then, although there’s been some bumps along the way. Alibaba now sits just above the 10-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages ahead of earnings.\n\nTo lose this trifecta of moving averages would be a negative development, putting the 21-day moving average and $240 level in play.\n\nShould those levels fail as support, $225 or lower might be on the table, with the recent lows again coming into play near $211 and the 100-week moving average.\n\nBulls are hoping that Alibaba delivers a solid result and management reassures investors on its current political situation in China. If it can do that, more upside is possible.\n\nSpecifically, longs would love to see Alibaba reclaim the 100-day moving average near $271. Doing so would also trigger a two-times monthly-up rotation, meaning Alibaba would take out the January and December high, at $269 and $271.30, respectively.\n\nThat could open the door to $280, eventually followed by a gap-fill at $290.50.\n\nThe bottom line: Let’s see how the stock trades after the report. Below $250 will have us cautious. Above $271 will have us bullish."

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nHow important are dividends to a stock investor’s profits? Speaking before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on October 15, 2007, investing guru John Bogle laid out the case: “Over the past 81 years… reinvested dividend income accounted for approximately 95 percent of the compound long-term return earned by the companies in the S&P 500. These stunning figures would seem to demand that mutual funds highlight the importance of dividend income.” So in other words, dividends are pretty important! Of course, right now the average stock on the S&P 500 is only paying about a 2% dividend yield, which isn’t a lot. If you want to do better than that, though, the REIT sector is a great place to begin your search for high-yield dividend stocks. REITs are companies that acquire, own, operate, and manage real estate portfolios, usually some combination of residential or commercial real properties, or their associated mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Tax law requires that these companies return profits directly to shareholders, and most of them choose dividends as their vehicle of choice for compliance, resulting in frequent high dividend yields across the sector. The slowly ebbing COVID pandemic was hard on real estate managers, as tenants had trouble making rents and owners had trouble leasing vacant space. However, BTIG analyst Tim Hayes believes there are reasons to stay bullish on CRE properties specifically. \"While we recognize the headwinds to commercial real estate (CRE) fundamentals and the potential risk to equity/earnings power, we believe there are several reasons to be constructive, especially with the sector trading at a discount to historical levels and offering attractive dividend yields at wide spreads to benchmark rates,\" Hayes commented. Against this backdrop, we’ve opened up the TipRanks database to get the latest stats on Hayes’ CRE choices. These are stocks that the analyst initiated Buy ratings on, pointing out their high dividend yield. We are talking about at least 9% here. Ares Commercial Real Estate (ACRE) The first dividend pick we are looking at is Ares Commercial Real Estate, a company focused on the commercial real estate mortgage sector. Ares boasts a diversified portfolio – featuring office space, apartments, hotels, and mixed-use properties – mainly across the Southeast and West. The company has over $2 billion invested in 49 separate loans, 95% of which are senior mortgage loans. At the end of October, the company released 3Q20 earnings (the last reported quarter), showing $22.4 million in total revenue, for a 13% year-over-year gain. The 45-cents earnings per common share was up 40% since the prior year. Furthermore, Ares closed a $667 million commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, with firmed up funding on 23 senior loans. On the dividend front, Ares declared in December its 4Q20 dividend. The payment, at 33 cents per common share, was paid out on January 15 – and is fully covered by current income levels. At current rates, the dividend annualizes to $1.32 and gives an impressive yield of 10.50%. Among the bulls is Hayes, who wrote: “We believe shares of ACRE are unfairly discounted relative to other commercial mREITs given strong Ares sponsorship, a very healthy balance sheet, and limited exposure to at-risk assets.” In his view, this leaves the company “well positioned to face the headwinds from COVID-19.” In line with these comments, Hayes rates ACRE a Buy, and his $13.50 price target implies a 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Only one other analyst has posted a recent ACRE review, also rating the stock a Buy, which makes the analyst consensus here a Moderate Buy. Shares are priced at $12.28, and their $12.75 average price target suggests room for modest ~4% growth. (See ACRE stock analysis on TipRanks) KKR Real Estate Finance Trust (KREF) Next up we have KKR, which operates in the commercial real estate sector, with almost half of its holdings in the states of New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The company both owns and finances commercial properties; 83% of its activities are with apartment dwellings and office spaces in desirable urban locations. KKR’s quality can be seen in the company’s quarterly results. The liquidity position was strong – KKR reported $700.6 million available at the end of 3Q20, the last quarter reported. The 56-cent EPS was up 7% sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. Further evidence of KKR’s sound position came at the beginning of January, when the announced it had closed 7 new commercial loans in Q4, totaling $565.4 million. This level of activity is a clear sign that KKR is recovering from the pandemic-related economic turndown. The solid foundation put the company in position to continue its dividend – which has been kept reliable for four years now. The most recent declaration, made in December, was for a 43-cent per common share dividend that was paid out in mid-January. That rate gives an annual payment of $1.72 per common share, and a robust yield of 9.7%. Covering KREF, Hayes is most impressed by the company’s move back toward proactive loan origination, saying, “We view 4Q20 origination activity to be in line with pre-pandemic production, and demonstrates a shift from “defense” to “offense” as transaction activity has picked up and the capital markets remain accommodative. We expect increased capital deployment to support earnings power and dividend coverage, and could potentially warrant an increase in the dividend as the macroeconomic outlook improves.” To this end, Hayes gives KREF a Buy and sets a $19.50 price target that indicates ~6% growth from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Wall Street has been keeping quiet on all things KREF, and the only other recent review also recommends a Buy. Put together, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at 19.26 and implies a modest ~5% upside. (See KREF stock analysis on TipRanks) Starwood Property Trust (STWD) For the third stock on Hayes’ list of picks, we turn to Starwood, a commercial mortgage REIT with a varied portfolio of first mortgages and mezzanine loans, in the $50 million to $500 million range. The company operates in the US and Europe, boasts a $5.9 billion market cap, and has offices in New York, London, and San Francisco. Starwood’s high-end portfolio has brought it solid earnings, even during the ‘corona recession’ of 2020. The company recorded $152 million in GAAP earnings for 3Q20, coming out to 53 cents per share, for gains of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. With that in the background, we can note the company’s dividend, which has been held steady at 48 cents per share for over two years. The last declaration was made in December, and the dividend was paid out on January 15. At the current rate, it annualizes to $1.92 and the yield is 9.23%. Once again, we’re looking at a stock that Hayes recommends to Buy. “We view STWD to be one of the few “blue chips” in the commercial mREIT sector given its size, liquidity, best-in-class management team, strong balance sheet, and diversified investment platform which has consistently generated stronger ROEs than peers. To that end, STWD is one of few commercial mREITs that neither restructured its liabilities with expensive rescue capital nor cut its dividend since the onset of COVID-19,” Hayes opined. Overall, there is little action on the Street heading STWD's way right now, with only one other analyst chiming in with a view on the company's prospects. An additional Buy rating means STWD qualifies as a Moderate Buy. However, the $21 average price target suggests shares will remain range bound for the foreseeable future.

Annual active consumers on our China retail marketplaces was 779 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, representing a quarterly net increase of 22 million. We continue to grow consumer mindshare and wallet share among our users, as reflected in higher purchase frequency from all city tiers.\n\nWe continued to increase penetration in less developed areas, reflecting our success in broadening product offering to meet diverse demand. One of the key drivers of our acquisition of new users and consumers in less developed areas is Taobao Deals (特价版). During the quarter, Taobao Deals achieved rapid user growth by continuing to expand its value-for-money product supply and focusing on user acquisition initiatives. Annual active consumers of Taobao Deals reached over 100 million for the twelve months period ended December 31, 2020 and mobile MAUs of Taobao Deals also reached over 100 million in December 2020.\n\nProduct Supply\n\nTmall online physical goods GMV, excluding unpaid orders, grew 19% year-over-year during the December 2020 quarter, supported primarily by rapid growth of the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and home furnishing categories, while growth of the consumer electronics category accelerated year-over-year. The year-over-year growth rate of Taobao online physical goods GMV, excluding unpaid orders, was robust for the December 2020 quarter, primarily driven by solid growth of the apparel and accessories, home furnishing and consumer electronics categories.\n\nWe celebrated the twelfth annual 11.11 Global Shopping Festival in the quarter, featuring a number of key changes in order to better serve brands and enhance consumer experience. We extended what originally was a one-day festival occurring on November 11 to 11 days, running from November 1 through November 11, 2020. This change created greater opportunities for merchants and brands to increase sales and build engagement and relationships with their customers. The extended festival also enhanced the overall shopping experience of consumers by reducing pressure on logistics demand and ensuring timely order delivery. The new approach yielded strong results, attracting a total of over 250,000 brands and 5 million merchants and generating RMB498.2 billion (US$74.1 billion) in GMV, excluding unpaid orders, during the 11-day campaign, an increase of 26% compared to the same timeframe in 2019. Over 470 brands achieved more than RMB100 million in sales, showcasing the virtuous cycle effects of digital transformation across our ecosystem. The shopping festival was also an opportunity for brands to launch new products and build brand awareness. During the festival this year, there were approximately 30 million new product launches and GMV, excluding unpaid orders, for new products grew strongly by 35% year-over-year.\n\nTmall Global is the premier platform through which international brands and merchants enter the China market online and build brand awareness. The number of brands and merchants on the Tmall Global platform as of December 31, 2020 grew over 60% year-over-year. In order to better connect international brands with Chinese consumers, Tmall Global continued to innovate in its cross-border logistics solutions. Brands that do not have a physical presence in China can now store inventory in our warehouses located in their home markets, and Tmall Global facilitates export to China when orders are placed. This service leverages the capabilities and economies of scale of Alibaba’s logistics infrastructure to enable brands to quickly enter the China market while reducing sales uncertainty and controlling costs. Purchases of products warehoused and shipped from overseas by Tmall Global grew rapidly, achieving triple-digit year-over-year growth in GMV, excluding unpaid orders, during the December quarter.\n\nEngagement\n\nDuring the December quarter, we introduced the Follow (订阅) and Entertain (逛逛) features on the front-page of the Taobao app, which further improved user engagement with brands, merchants, key opinion leaders (KOLs), vloggers and content creators. On the Follow landing page, consumers can view new products and promotions offered by the stores they follow or in which they have memberships. This feature is an effective method to enhance consumer loyalty with quality merchants and brands. By browsing the Entertain channel, consumers can learn about the latest consumption and lifestyle trends as well as follow their favorite KOLs, vloggers and content creators. During the quarter, page views enabled through Taobao front page recommendations grew strongly by over 90% year-over-year.\n\nTaobao Live is an indispensable branding, marketing and distribution tool that allows consumers to directly interact with brands, merchants and KOLs through livestreaming sessions. Our own businesses, such as Juhuasuan, Ele.me and Fliggy, are also increasingly leveraging Taobao Live to attract and engage with consumers. Taobao Live generated over RMB400 billion in GMV for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n\nNew Retail – gaining market share in the grocery category using multi-banner and multi-format strategy\n\nIn October 2020, we completed our acquisition of a controlling stake in Sun Art Retail Group Limited (\"Sun Art\"), a leading hypermarket operator in China, and started consolidating Sun Art’s results in our financial statements. The increased investment in Sun Art will allow us to digitalize its offline traffic, synchronize online and offline channel inventory, broaden supply chain network and increase online purchases. In the quarter ended December 31, 2020, online purchases, a majority of which was driven by Alibaba’s digital technology, represented 24% of Sun Art’s sales of goods.\n\nOur self-operated grocery retail chain Freshippo (known as \"Hema\" in Chinese) achieved healthy double-digit same-store sales growth during the quarter as we continued to optimize its product supply and improve customer experience. As of December 31, 2020, we self-operated 246 Freshippo stores in China. Freshippo will continue to adopt a multi-format and multi-banner expansion strategy by developing new shopping formats and scenarios for consumption of food and beverage and general merchandise. During the quarter, Freshippo opened its first \"X Membership\" warehouse store in Shanghai, which features high-quality products at competitive prices that can be purchased only by store members.\n\nLocal Consumer Services – fast and high-quality growth of merchants and consumers\n\nDemand for digitalization in the restaurant and service industry remains strong after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Ele.me has continued to capture this market opportunity, attracting high-quality merchants by providing digital technology solutions and other value-added services. The number of registered merchants grew over 30% year-over-year as of December 31, 2020.\n\nEle.me’s average daily number of paying members in the December quarter grew about 30% year-over-year given the successful upgrade of our membership program and continued onboarding of high-quality merchants. As part of our New Retail strategy, Ele.me continues to expand its on-demand delivery services to cover a wider range of products in categories such as fresh produce and grocery. As of December 31, 2020, the number of non-restaurant registered merchants enabled by Ele.me increased by over 80% year-over-year.\n\nCainiao Network – improving efficiency across the Alibaba ecosystem and the logistics industry in China and internationally\n\nIn the December quarter, Cainiao Network revenue grew 51% year-over-year to RMB11,360 million (US$1,741 million), primarily due to the increase in volume of orders fulfilled from our fast growing cross-border and international commerce retail businesses. Cainiao had positive operating cash flow during the quarter.\n\nCainiao Network continued to expand both its domestic services and global smart logistics infrastructure by deepening integration with logistics partners as well as offering more products and services. In China, Cainiao and its partners processed over 2.3 billion orders during the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival while continuing to improve delivery time to enhance consumer experience. Internationally, Cainiao and its partners continued to invest in smart logistics infrastructure to serve our global merchants and to help alleviate logistics capacity constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2020, Cainiao deployed more than 200 international chartered cargo flights for our AliExpress business, which resulted in improved fulfilment efficiency for AliExpress orders and a reduction of average delivery time by 3.5 days for order deliveries from China to international markets.\n\nInternational – consistent strong growth in Southeast Asia and growth recovery of AliExpress\n\nLazada – Our Southeast Asian e-commerce platform Lazada continued to achieve robust growth in both buyers and sellers, benefiting from acceleration of digitalization across industries in Southeast Asia. Lazada recorded another quarter of triple-digit year-over-year order growth despite new waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in many markets where it operates.\n\nAliExpress – Despite logistics disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in many markets where it operates, AliExpress, in partnership with Cainiao, continued to invest and upgrade its global logistics infrastructure to enhance its cross-border delivery capabilities and efficiency. These investments have supported an ongoing growth recovery since the trough in the March 2020 quarter. Excluding the Russia joint venture business, growth in GMV, excluding unpaid orders, has recovered to a pre-COVID pandemic level in the December quarter.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nAlibaba Cloud empowers the digital transformation of enterprises by providing comprehensive technology solutions and services in the cloud for a wide range of industries. In the December quarter, cloud computing revenue grew 50% year-over-year to RMB16,115 million (US$2,470 million), primarily driven by robust growth in revenue from customers in the Internet and retail industries and the public sector. For the first time, Alibaba Cloud achieved positive adjusted EBITA during the quarter due to the realization of economies of scale.\n\nDuring the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival, Alibaba Cloud provided a highly scalable, reliable and secure public cloud infrastructure, which at its peak processed 583,000 orders per second. Since we migrated our e-commerce businesses onto the public cloud a year ago, these businesses are now able to seamlessly create, upgrade and deploy on a cloud native approach; and this capability was especially important during the festival, helping us to improve operating efficiency and ensure business continuity.\n\nAlibaba Cloud continues to invest in research and development of leading cloud technologies to help our customers undertake digital transformation and enable the growth of their businesses. Our proprietary technologies have consistently won recognition from leading research and advisory organizations such as Gartner and Forrester. For example, according to Gartner’s November 2020 report, among the large-scale global cloud providers, Alibaba Cloud is the only Chinese company with the Leader ranking for database management system under Gartner’s Magic Quadrant measurement.\n\nDigital Media and Entertainment\n\nYouku maintained its strong focus on providing a superior user experience and blockbuster content in a wide range of genres. During the quarter, Youku’s average daily subscriber base increased around 30% year-over-year, driven by the appeal of its original content and continued contribution from the 88VIP membership program.\n\nAlibaba Pictures continued its solid track record in content investment and distribution. For example, Alibaba Pictures invested in and distributed the top three grossing films during the three-day New Year holiday in China, which accounted for over 80% of China box office sales during the period according to Beacon Box Office data. Alibaba Pictures’ popular original dramas, such as Professional Single, also contributed to Youku’s strong subscription growth during the quarter. In addition, Alibaba Pictures enhanced the production capabilities of popular original dramas that are exclusively featured on Youku and increased IP commercialization by content owners on our online marketplaces.\n\nWe continued to improve the operational efficiency of our digital media and entertainment businesses through disciplined investment in content and production capability. During the quarter, adjusted EBITA loss for the digital media and entertainment segment narrowed year-over-year.\n\nCash Flow from Operating Activities and Free Cash Flow\n\nIn the December 2020 quarter, net cash provided by operating activities was RMB103,208 million (US$15,817 million), an increase of 7% compared to RMB96,505 million in the same quarter of 2019. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, increased by 23% to RMB96,210 million (US$14,745 million), from RMB78,279 million in the same quarter of 2019, mainly due to our robust profit growth. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this results announcement.\n\nShare Repurchase\n\nOn December 28, 2020, we announced that our board of directors authorized an upsize of our share repurchase program from US$6 billion to US$10 billion, for a two-year period through the end of 2022. During the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased approximately 540,000 of our ADSs (or approximately 4.3 million of our ordinary shares) for approximately US$118 million under the share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 21.7 billion ordinary shares (equivalent to approximately 2.71 billion ADSs) issued and outstanding.\n\nAnti-monopoly Investigation\n\nOn December 24, 2020, Alibaba Group received a notice of an investigation from the State Administration for Market Regulation (\"SAMR\") that it had commenced an investigation pursuant to the PRC Anti-monopoly Law. The investigation is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the SAMR. We have established a special taskforce with leaders from our relevant business units to conduct internal reviews. We will continue to actively communicate with the SAMR on compliance with regulatory requirements. We will further update the market when the investigation is concluded.\n\nUpdate on Ant Group\n\nOn November 3, 2020, Ant Group announced the suspension of its proposed dual listings and initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Due to recent significant changes in the Fintech regulatory environment in China, Ant Group is in the process of developing its rectification plan, which will need to go through the relevant regulatory procedures. Therefore, Ant Group’s business prospects and IPO plans are subject to substantial uncertainties. Currently, we are unable to make a complete and fair assessment of the impact that these changes and uncertainties will have on Alibaba Group. We will update the market once Ant Group has completed the relevant regulatory procedures for its rectification plan.\n\nKEY OPERATIONAL METRICS*\n\nDecember 31, September 30, December 31, Net adds 2019 2020 2020 YoY QoQ China Commerce Retail: Annual active consumers(1) (in millions) 711 757 779 68 22 Mobile monthly active users (MAUs)(2) (in millions) 824 881 902 78 21\n\n_____________________ * For definitions of terms used but not defined in this results announcement, please refer to our annual report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020.

This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation. (2) Unallocated expenses primarily relate to corporate administrative costs and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to individual segments. (3) Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB73,327 million (US$11,238 million). A reconciliation of adjusted EBITA for core commerce to marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA is included at the end of this results announcement.\n\nDECEMBER QUARTER OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RESULTS\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB221,084 million (US$33,883 million), an increase of 37% compared to RMB161,456 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase was mainly driven by the robust revenue growth of our China commerce retail business, which includes the consolidation of Sun Art starting in October 2020, and the strong revenue growth of our cloud computing business. Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our revenue would have grown 27% year-over-year.\n\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by segment for the periods indicated:\n\nThree months ended December 31, 2019 2020 RMB % of\n\nRevenue RMB US$ % of\n\nRevenue YoY %\n\nChange (in millions, except percentages) Core commerce: China commerce retail - Customer management(1) 84,644 52% 101,919 15,620 46% 20% - Others(2) 25,814 16% 51,760 7,932 23% 101% 110,458 68% 153,679 23,552 69% 39% China commerce wholesale 3,365 2% 3,831 587 2% 14% International commerce retail 7,396 5% 10,158 1,557 5% 37% International commerce wholesale 2,457 1% 3,762 577 2% 53% Cainiao logistics services 7,518 5% 11,360 1,741 5% 51% Local consumer services 7,584 5% 8,348 1,279 4% 10% Others 2,697 2% 4,403 675 2% 63% Total core commerce 141,475 88% 195,541 29,968 89% 38% Cloud computing 10,721 7% 16,115 2,470 7% 50% Digital media and entertainment(3) 8,028 5% 8,079 1,238 4% 1% Innovation initiatives and others(3) 1,232 0% 1,349 207 0% 9% Total 161,456 100% 221,084 33,883 100% 37%\n\n_____________________ (1) We presented our commission revenue as part of customer management revenue in order to better reflect our value proposition to merchants on our platforms. Comparative figures were presented in the same manner accordingly. (2) \"Others\" revenue under China commerce retail is primarily generated by our New Retail and direct sales businesses, comprising mainly Sun Art, Tmall Supermarket, Freshippo, direct import and Intime. (3) Beginning on April 1, 2020, we reclassified revenue from our self-developed online games business, which was previously reported under the innovation initiatives and others segment, as revenue from digital media and entertainment segment because it has moved beyond the incubation stage. This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.\n\nCore commerce\n\nChina commerce retail business\n\n\n\nRevenue from our China commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB153,679 million (US$23,552 million), an increase of 39% compared to RMB110,458 million in the same quarter of 2019. Customer management revenue grew 20% year-over-year, primarily due to robust growth in revenue from new monetization formats, such as recommendation feeds, an increase in the average unit price per click in search monetization, as well as the 19% year-over-year growth of Tmall online physical goods GMV, excluding unpaid orders.\n\n\n\n\"Others\" revenue under China commerce retail business was RMB51,760 million (US$7,932 million), achieving year-over-year growth of 101% compared to RMB25,814 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the consolidation of Sun Art, as well as the contributions from our direct sales businesses, including Tmall Supermarket and Freshippo.\n\n\n\nThe proportion of revenue from our direct sales businesses increased this quarter after we began to consolidate Sun Art in October 2020. We expect that the proportion of revenue of our direct sales businesses will continue to increase as we further implement our New Retail strategy.\n\nChina commerce wholesale business\n\n\n\nRevenue from our China commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB3,831 million (US$587 million), an increase of 14% compared to RMB3,365 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in both average revenue from paying members and the number of paying members on 1688.com.\n\nInternational commerce retail business\n\n\n\nRevenue from our international commerce retail business in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB10,158 million (US$1,557 million), an increase of 37% compared to RMB7,396 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to the growth in revenue generated by Lazada and Trendyol.\n\nInternational commerce wholesale business\n\n\n\nRevenue from our international commerce wholesale business in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB3,762 million (US$577 million), an increase of 53% compared to RMB2,457 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase was primarily due to increases in both the number of paying members and average revenue from paying members on Alibaba.com, as well as an increase in revenue generated by cross-border related value-added services.\n\nCainiao logistics services\n\n\n\nRevenue from Cainiao Network’s logistics services, which represents revenue from its domestic and international one-stop-shop logistics services and supply chain management solutions, after elimination of inter-company transactions, was RMB11,360 million (US$1,741 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 51% compared to RMB7,518 million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to the increase in volume of orders fulfilled from our fast growing cross-border and international commerce retail businesses.\n\nLocal consumer services\n\n\n\nRevenue from local consumer services, which primarily represents platform commissions, fees from provision of delivery services and other services provided by our on-demand delivery and local services platform Ele.me, was RMB8,348 million (US$1,279 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, an increase of 10% compared to RMB7,584 million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to an increase in GMV as well as more efficient use of subsidies that is contra revenue.\n\nCloud computing\n\nRevenue from our cloud computing business in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB16,115 million (US$2,470 million), an increase of 50% compared to RMB10,721 million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily driven by robust growth in revenue from customers in the Internet and retail industries and the public sector.\n\nDigital media and entertainment\n\nRevenue from our digital media and entertainment segment in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB8,079 million (US$1,238 million), an increase of 1% compared to RMB8,028 million in the same quarter of 2019. The slight increase was primarily due to the increase in revenue from online games business, largely offset by the decrease in revenue from customer management.\n\nInnovation initiatives and others\n\nRevenue from innovation initiatives and others in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB1,349 million (US$207 million), an increase of 9% compared to RMB1,232 million in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nCosts and Expenses\n\nThe following tables set forth a breakdown of our costs and expenses, share-based compensation expense and costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expense by function for the periods indicated.\n\nThree months ended December 31, % of\n\nRevenue\n\nYoY\n\nchange 2019 2020 RMB % of\n\nRevenue RMB US$ % of\n\nRevenue (in millions, except percentages) Costs and expenses: Cost of revenue 84,332 52% 121,268 18,585 55% 3% Product development expenses 11,077 7% 13,607 2,086 6% (1)% Sales and marketing expenses 15,800 9% 25,343 3,884 11% 2% General and administrative expenses 7,415 5% 8,692 1,332 4% (1)% Amortization of intangible assets 3,272 2% 3,172 486 2% 0% Total costs and expenses 121,896 75% 172,082 26,373 78% 3% Share-based compensation expense: Cost of revenue 1,685 1% 2,143 329 1% 0% Product development expenses 3,644 2% 4,022 616 2% 0% Sales and marketing expenses 961 0% 1,085 166 0% 0% General and administrative expenses 1,540 1% 1,829 280 1% 0% Total share-based compensation expense 7,830 4% 9,079 1,391 4% 0% Costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expense: Cost of revenue 82,647 51% 119,125 18,256 54% 3% Product development expenses 7,433 5% 9,585 1,470 4% (1)% Sales and marketing expenses 14,839 9% 24,258 3,718 11% 2% General and administrative expenses 5,875 4% 6,863 1,052 3% (1)% Amortization of intangible assets 3,272 2% 3,172 486 2% 0% Total costs and expenses excluding share-based compensation expense 114,066 71% ... 163,003 24,982 74% 3%\n\nCost of revenue – Cost of revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB121,268 million (US$18,585 million), or 55% of revenue, compared to RMB84,332 million, or 52% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2019. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 51% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 54% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher proportion of our direct sales businesses from the consolidation of Sun Art as well as the growth of our Tmall Supermarket and New Retail businesses, which resulted in increased cost of inventory, partly offset by a decrease in delivery costs per order of our local consumer services and a decrease in content costs of our digital media and entertainment segment.\n\nProduct development expenses – Product development expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were RMB13,607 million (US$2,086 million), or 6% of revenue, compared to RMB11,077 million, or 7% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2019. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, product development expenses as a percentage of revenue would have decreased from 5% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 4% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.\n\nSales and marketing expenses – Sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were RMB25,343 million (US$3,884 million), or 11% of revenue, compared to RMB15,800 million, or 9% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2019. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue would have increased from 9% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 11% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in marketing and promotional spending for user acquisition and retention on our China retail marketplaces.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses – General and administrative expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were RMB8,692 million (US$1,332 million), or 4% of revenue, compared to RMB7,415 million, or 5% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2019. Without the effect of share-based compensation expense, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue would have decreased from 4% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 3% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.\n\nShare-based compensation expense – Total share-based compensation expense included in the cost and expense items above in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB9,079 million (US$1,391 million), an increase of 16% compared to RMB7,830 million in the same quarter of 2019. Share-based compensation expense as a percentage of revenue remained stable at 4% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same quarter last year.\n\nThe following table sets forth our analysis of share-based compensation expense for the quarters indicated by type of share-based awards:\n\nThree months ended December 31,\n\n2019 September 30,\n\n2020 December 31,\n\n2020 % Change RMB % of\n\nRevenue RMB % of\n\nRevenue RMB US$ % of\n\nRevenue YoY QoQ (in millions, except percentages) By type of awards: Alibaba Group share-based awards(1) 6,587 4% 7,703 5% 7,694 1,179 4% 17 % (0) % Ant Group share-based awards(2) 347 0% 16,056 10% 542 83 0% 56 % (97) % Others(3) 896 0% 935 1% 843 129 0% (6) % (10) % Total share-based compensation expense 7,830 4% 24,694 16% 9,079 1,391 4% 16 % (63) %\n\n_____________________ (1) This represents Alibaba Group share-based awards granted to our employees. (2) This represents Ant Group share-based awards granted to our employees, which is subject to mark-to-market accounting treatment. (3) Others includes share-based awards of our subsidiaries.\n\nShare-based compensation expense related to Alibaba Group share-based awards remained stable in this quarter compared to the previous quarter.\n\nShare-based compensation expense related to Ant Group share-based awards decreased in this quarter compared to the previous quarter, mainly due to the recognition of an increase in the value of these awards in the previous quarter.\n\nWe expect that our share-based compensation expense will continue to be affected by changes in the fair value of the underlying awards and the quantity of awards we grant in the future.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets – Amortization of intangible assets in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB3,172 million (US$486 million), a decrease of 3% from RMB3,272 million in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nIncome from operations and operating margin\n\nIncome from operations in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB49,002 million (US$7,510 million), or 22% of revenue, an increase of 24% compared to RMB39,560 million, or 25% of revenue, in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA increased 22% year-over-year to RMB68,380 million (US$10,480 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to RMB55,880 million in the same quarter of 2019. Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our adjusted EBITDA would have grown 21% year-over-year.\n\nAdjusted EBITA increased 21% year-over-year to RMB61,253 million (US$9,387 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to RMB50,662 million in the same quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITA is included at the end of this results announcement.\n\nAdjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin by segments\n\nAdjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITA margin by segments are set forth in the table below. See the section entitled \"Information by Segments\" above for a reconciliation of income from operations to adjusted EBITA.\n\nThree months ended December 31, 2019 2020 RMB % of\n\nSegment\n\nRevenue RMB US$ % of\n\nSegment\n\nRevenue (in millions, except percentages) Core commerce 58,075 41 % 66,637 10,213 34 % Cloud computing (356 ) (3 )% 24 3 0 % Digital media and entertainment(1) (3,400 ) (42 )% (1,389 ) (213 ) (17 )% Innovation initiatives and others(1) (1,768 ) (144 )% (1,992 ) (305 ) (148 )%\n\n_____________________ (1) Beginning on April 1, 2020, we reclassified the results of our self-developed online games business, which was previously reported under the innovation initiatives and others segment, to the digital media and entertainment segment because it has moved beyond the incubation stage. This reclassification conforms to the way that we manage and monitor segment performance. Comparative figures were reclassified to conform to this presentation.\n\nCore commerce segment – Adjusted EBITA increased by 15% to RMB66,637 million (US$10,213 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to RMB58,075 million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily due to an increase in marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA as well as reduced losses for local consumer services business. Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA increased 10% year-over-year to RMB73,327 million (US$11,238 million). The growth rate of marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA has been decreasing because of our increased strategic investments in certain new businesses within China retail marketplaces. Our investments in new business initiatives within China retail marketplaces, such as Taobao Deals, Taobao Live, Taobao Short Video and Taobao Grocery, will expand our addressable market in China by enhancing consumer experience and loyalty and increasing penetration into less developed areas.\n\nAdjusted EBITA margin decreased from 41% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 to 34% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to the consolidation of Sun Art and the increased revenue contribution from our self-operated New Retail and direct sales businesses, in respect of which revenue is recorded on a gross basis, including the cost of inventory.\n\nA reconciliation of adjusted EBITA for core commerce to marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA is included at the end of this results announcement.\n\nWe expect that our core commerce adjusted EBITA margin will continue to be affected by the pace of our investment in new businesses and the growth of our self-operated New Retail and direct sales businesses.\n\nCloud computing segment – Adjusted EBITA of RMB24 million (US$3 million) in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was profitable for the first time, compared to a loss of RMB356 million in the same quarter of 2019, primarily attributable to the realization of economies of scale.\n\nDigital media and entertainment segment – Adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was a loss of RMB1,389 million (US$213 million), compared to a loss of RMB3,400 million in the same quarter of 2019. Adjusted EBITA margin improved to negative 17% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 from negative 42% in the quarter ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to reduced losses in Youku and increased contribution from our online games business.\n\nInnovation initiatives and others segment – Adjusted EBITA in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was a loss of RMB1,992 million (US$305 million), compared to a loss of RMB1,768 million in the same quarter of 2019, mainly due to our investments in technological research and innovation.\n\nInterest and investment income, net\n\nInterest and investment income, net in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB40,036 million (US$6,135 million), an increase from RMB17,136 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the net gain arising from increases in the market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies in the quarter ended December 31, 2020. In addition, we recognized a one-time gain of RMB6.4 billion (US$981 million) arising from the revaluation of our previously held equity interests in Sun Art upon our consolidation in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to a one-time gain of RMB10.3 billion recognized in relation to our deconsolidation of AliExpress Russia businesses in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nThe above-mentioned gains were excluded from our non-GAAP net income.\n\nOther income, net\n\nOther income, net in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB2,826 million (US$433 million), compared to RMB987 million in the same quarter of 2019. The increase in other income, net was primarily due to the increase in the amount of input VAT super-credit that can be offset against our VAT payable.\n\nIncome tax expenses\n\nIncome tax expenses in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 were RMB9,194 million (US$1,409 million), compared to RMB8,407 million in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nOur effective tax rate was 10% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to 15% in the same quarter of 2019. Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of investments, as well as deferred tax effects arising from our share of results of equity method investees, our effective tax rate would have been 17% in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.\n\nShare of results of equity method investees\n\nShare of results of equity method investees in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was a loss of RMB3,601 million (US$552 million), compared to a profit of RMB2,165 million in the same quarter of 2019. Share of results of equity method investees in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and the comparative periods consisted of the following:\n\nThree months ended December 31, 2019 September 30, 2020 December 31, 2020 RMB RMB RMB US$ (in millions) Share of profit (loss) of equity method investees - Ant Group 215 4,681 4,796 735 - Others 2,229 987 (100 ) (15 ) Impairment loss — (5 ) (7,196 ) (1,103 ) Dilution gain (loss) 166 (3 ) (19 ) (3 ) Others(1) (445 ) (1,416 ) (1,082 ) (166 ) Total 2,165 4,244 (3,601 ) (552 )\n\n_____________________ (1) Others mainly include amortization of intangible assets of equity method investees and share-based compensation expense related to share-based awards granted to employees of our equity method investees.\n\nWe record our share of results of all equity method investees one quarter in arrears. We recorded a share of loss of other equity method investees in the quarter ended December 31, 2020, compared to a share of profit of other equity method investees in the same quarter of 2019, primarily because our share of profit of Suning in the quarter ended December 31, 2019 included a significant one-time gain arising from Suning’s deconsolidation of one of its subsidiaries. In addition, we recorded an impairment loss of RMB7,196 million (US$1,103 million) in this quarter with respect to certain equity method investees as a result of their prolonged decline in market values against our carrying values.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread disruption to the economy, and the businesses of our equity method investees may continue to be adversely affected, which could negatively impact our share of results of equity method investees in future periods.\n\nNet income and Non-GAAP net income\n\nOur net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB77,977 million (US$11,950 million), an increase of 56% compared to RMB50,132 million in the same quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to an increase in the net gain arising from increases in the market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.\n\nExcluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP net income in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB59,207 million (US$9,074 million), an increase of 27% compared to RMB46,493 million in the same quarter of 2019. A reconciliation of net income to non-GAAP net income is included at the end of this results announcement.\n\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders\n\nNet income attributable to ordinary shareholders in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB79,427 million (US$12,173 million), an increase of 52% compared to RMB52,309 million in the same quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to an increase in the net gain arising from increases in the market prices of our equity investments in publicly-traded companies in the quarter ended December 31, 2020.\n\nDiluted earnings per ADS/share and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share\n\nDiluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB28.85 (US$4.42) on a weighted average of 22,021 million diluted shares outstanding during the quarter, an increase of 48% compared to RMB19.55 on a weighted average of 21,393 million diluted shares outstanding during the same quarter in 2019. Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB22.03 (US$3.38), an increase of 21% compared to RMB18.19 in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nDiluted earnings per share in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB3.61 (US$0.55 or HK$4.29), an increase of 48% compared to RMB2.44 in the same quarter of 2019. Excluding share-based compensation expense, revaluation and disposal gains/losses of investments, impairment of investments and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB2.75 (US$0.42 or HK$3.27), an increase of 21%, compared to RMB2.27 in the same quarter of 2019.\n\nA reconciliation of diluted earnings per ADS/share to non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS/share is included at the end of this results announcement. Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB456,314 million (US$69,933 million), compared to RMB405,912 million as of September 30, 2020. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to free cash flow generated from operations of RMB96,210 million (US$14,745 million), partly offset by cash used in investment and acquisition activities of RMB46,852 million (US$7,180 million).\n\nCash flow from operating activities and free cash flow\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 was RMB103,208 million (US$15,817 million), an increase of 7% compared to RMB96,505 million in the same quarter of 2019. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP measurement of liquidity, in the quarter ended December 31, 2020 increased by 23% to RMB96,210 million (US$14,745 million), from RMB78,279 million in the same quarter of 2019, mainly due to our robust profit growth. A reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow is included at the end of this results announcement.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities\n\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities of RMB79,712 million (US$12,216 million) primarily reflected (i) cash outflow of RMB46,852 million (US$7,180 million) for investment and acquisition activities, including the acquisition of Sun Art, (ii) an increase in short-term investments by RMB28,433 million (US$4,358 million), as well as (iii) capital expenditures of RMB5,844 million (US$895 million), which included cash outflow for acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses of RMB975 million (US$149 million).\n\nWe adopted ASU 2019-02, \"Entertainment — Films — Other Assets — Film Costs (Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment — Broadcasters — Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350),\" on April 1, 2020. As a result of our adoption of this new accounting update, we are now reporting cash outflows for the acquisition of licensed copyrights as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows prospectively beginning on April 1, 2020. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2019-02, cash outflows for the acquisition of licensed copyrights were previously classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nEmployees\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 252,084 employees, compared to 122,399 as of September 30, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the consolidation of Sun Art.\n\nWEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\n\nAlibaba Group’s management will hold a conference call to discuss the financial results at 7:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (8:30 p.m. Hong Kong Time) on February 2, 2021.\n\nDetails of the conference call are as follows:\n\nInternational: +65 6713 5330\n\nU.S.: +1 347 549 4094\n\nU.K.: +44 203 713 5084\n\nHong Kong: +852 3018 8307\n\nChina Landline: 800 820 2079\n\nChina Mobile: 400 820 6895\n\nConference ID: 4649348 (English)\n\nConference ID: 1047169 (simultaneous interpretation in Chinese, listen only mode)\n\nA live webcast of the earnings conference call can be accessed at http://www.alibabagroup.com/en/ir/earnings.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please refer to the section entitled \"Information about Segments\" and the table captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures\" in this results announcement.\n\nWe believe that adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of certain income or expenses that we include in income from operations, net income and diluted earnings per share/ADS. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about our core operating results, enhance the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We present three different income measures, namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA and non-GAAP net income, as well as one measure that provides supplemental information on our core commerce segment, namely marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA, in order to provide more information and greater transparency to investors about our operating results.\n\nWe consider free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by our business that can be used for strategic corporate transactions, including investing in our new business initiatives, making strategic investments and acquisitions and strengthening our balance sheet.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITA, marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share/ADS and free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to income from operations, adjusted EBITA for core commerce, net income, diluted earnings per share/ADS, cash flows or any other measure of performance or as an indicator of our operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented here do not have standardized meanings prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures to our data.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, (ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, depreciation of property and equipment, operating lease cost relating to land use rights and impairment of goodwill, which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.\n\nAdjusted EBITA represents net income before (i) interest and investment income, net, interest expense, other income, net, income tax expenses and share of results of equity method investees, (ii) certain non-cash expenses, consisting of share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill, which we do not believe are reflective of our core operating performance during the periods presented.\n\nMarketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA represents adjusted EBITA for core commerce excluding the effects of (i) local consumer services, (ii) Lazada, (iii) New Retail and direct import and (iv) Cainiao Network. Marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA reflects the performance of our most established businesses, namely, those of our China retail marketplaces and wholesale marketplaces which primarily adopt a marketplace-based approach. By excluding certain businesses that are in the earlier stages of their development and with business approaches that continue to evolve, marketplace-based core commerce adjusted EBITA enables investors to clearly evaluate the performance of our most established businesses on a like-for-like basis.\n\nNon-GAAP net income represents net income before share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of investments and goodwill, gain or loss on deemed disposals/disposals/revaluation of investments, gain in relation to the receipt of the 33% equity interest in Ant Group, amortization of excess value receivable arising from the restructuring of commercial arrangements with Ant Group and others, as adjusted for the tax effects on non-GAAP adjustments.\n\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share represents non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods on a diluted basis. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS represents non-GAAP diluted earnings per share after adjustment to the ordinary share-to-ADS ratio.\n\nFree cash flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as presented in our consolidated cash flow statement less purchases of property and equipment (excluding acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses) and other intangible assets, as well as adjustments to exclude from net cash provided by operating activities the consumer protection fund deposits from merchants on our China retail marketplaces. Prior to April 1, 2020, we also deducted acquisition of licensed copyrights from cash flows from investing activities. After our adoption of ASU 2019-02, \"Entertainment — Films — Other Assets — Film Costs (Subtopic 926-20) and Entertainment — Broadcasters — Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Subtopic 920-350),\" on April 1, 2020, we changed the classification of cash outflows for the acquisition of licensed copyrights from investing activities to operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, prospectively beginning on April 1, 2020. We deduct certain items of cash flows from investing activities in order to provide greater transparency into cash flow from our revenue-generating business operations. We exclude \"acquisition of land use rights and construction in progress relating to office campuses\" because the office campuses are used by us for corporate and administrative purposes and are not directly related to our revenue-generating business operations. We also exclude consumer protection fund deposits from merchants on our China retail marketplaces because these deposits are restricted for the purpose of compensating consumers for claims against merchants.\n\nThe section entitled \"Information about Segments\" and the table captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable U.S. GAAP Measures\" in this results announcement have more details on the non-GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\n\nALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED\n\nUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\n\nThree months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, 2019 2020 2019 2020 RMB RMB US$ RMB RMB US$ (in millions, except per share data) (in millions, except per share data) Revenue 161,456 221,084 33,883 395,397 529,894 81,210 Cost of revenue (84,332 ) (121,268 ) (18,585 ) (209,865 ) (295,751 ) (45,326 ) Product development expenses (11,077 ) (13,607 ) (2,086 ) (32,493 ) (43,934 ) (6,733 ) Sales and marketing expenses (15,800 ) (25,343 ) (3,884 ) (38,494 ) (56,366 ) (8,639 ) General and administrative expenses (7,415 ) (8,692 ) (1,332 ) (20,326 ) (27,490 ) (4,213 ) Amortization of intangible assets (3,272 ) (3,172 ) (486 ) (9,344 ) (9,012 ) (1,381 ) Impairment of goodwill — — — (576 ) — — Income from operations 39,560 49,002 7,510 84,299 97,341 14,918 Interest and investment income, net 17,136 40,036 6,135 80,671 72,683 11,139 Interest expense (1,309 ) (1,092 ) (167 ) (4,015 ) (3,316 ) (508 ) Other income, net 987 2,826 433 6,259 5,467 838 Income before income tax and share of results of equity method investees 56,374 90,772 13,911 167,214 172,175 26,387 Income tax expenses (8,407 ) (9,194 ) (1,409 ) (17,934 ) (22,229 ) (3,407 ) Share of results of equity method investees 2,165 (3,601 ) (552 ) (9,278 ) 992 152 Net income 50,132 77,977 11,950 140,002 150,938 23,132 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 2,042 1,558 239 6,211 5,006 767 Net income attributable to Alibaba Group Holding Limited 52,174 79,535 12,189 146,213 155,944 23,899 Accretion of mezzanine equity 135 (108 ) (16 ) (112 ) (157 ) (24 ) Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders 52,309 79,427 12,173 146,101 155,787 23,875 Earnings per share attributable to ordinary shareholders(1) Basic 2.48 3.67 0.56 7.00 7.21 1.10 Diluted 2.44 3.61 0.55 6.89 7.09 1.09 Earnings per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders(1) Basic 19.87 29.36 4.50 55.98 57.68 8.84 Diluted 19.55 28.85 4.42 55.14 56.71 8.69 Weighted average number of shares used in calculating earnings per ordinary share (million shares)(1) Basic 21,058 21,643 20,878 21,608 Diluted 21,393 22,021 21,187 21,969\n\n_____________________ (1) Each ADS represents eight ordinary shares.\n\nALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LIMITED\n\nREVENUE\n\nThe following table sets forth our revenue by segments for the periods indicated:\n\nThree months ended December 31, Nine months ended December 31, 2019 2020 2019 2020 RMB RMB US$ RMB RMB US$ (in millions) (in millions) Core commerce(1) 141,475 195,541 29,968 342,239 459,781 70,465 Cloud computing(2) 10,721 16,115 2,470 27,799 43,359 6,645 Digital media and entertainment(3)(5) 8,028 8,079 1,238 21,896 23,139 3,546 Innovation initiatives and others(4)(5) 1,232 1,349 207 3,463 3,615 554 Total 161,456 221,084 33,883 395,397 529,894 81,210\n\n_____________________ (1) Revenue from core commerce is primarily generated from our China retail marketplaces, Freshippo, Sun Art, 1688.com, Lazada, AliExpress, Alibaba.com, local consumer services and Cainiao logistics services.

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nHow important are dividends to a stock investor’s profits? Speaking before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on October 15, 2007, investing guru John Bogle laid out the case: “Over the past 81 years… reinvested dividend income accounted for approximately 95 percent of the compound long-term return earned by the companies in the S&P 500. These stunning figures would seem to demand that mutual funds highlight the importance of dividend income.” So in other words, dividends are pretty important! Of course, right now the average stock on the S&P 500 is only paying about a 2% dividend yield, which isn’t a lot. If you want to do better than that, though, the REIT sector is a great place to begin your search for high-yield dividend stocks. REITs are companies that acquire, own, operate, and manage real estate portfolios, usually some combination of residential or commercial real properties, or their associated mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Tax law requires that these companies return profits directly to shareholders, and most of them choose dividends as their vehicle of choice for compliance, resulting in frequent high dividend yields across the sector. The slowly ebbing COVID pandemic was hard on real estate managers, as tenants had trouble making rents and owners had trouble leasing vacant space. However, BTIG analyst Tim Hayes believes there are reasons to stay bullish on CRE properties specifically. \"While we recognize the headwinds to commercial real estate (CRE) fundamentals and the potential risk to equity/earnings power, we believe there are several reasons to be constructive, especially with the sector trading at a discount to historical levels and offering attractive dividend yields at wide spreads to benchmark rates,\" Hayes commented. Against this backdrop, we’ve opened up the TipRanks database to get the latest stats on Hayes’ CRE choices. These are stocks that the analyst initiated Buy ratings on, pointing out their high dividend yield. We are talking about at least 9% here. Ares Commercial Real Estate (ACRE) The first dividend pick we are looking at is Ares Commercial Real Estate, a company focused on the commercial real estate mortgage sector. Ares boasts a diversified portfolio – featuring office space, apartments, hotels, and mixed-use properties – mainly across the Southeast and West. The company has over $2 billion invested in 49 separate loans, 95% of which are senior mortgage loans. At the end of October, the company released 3Q20 earnings (the last reported quarter), showing $22.4 million in total revenue, for a 13% year-over-year gain. The 45-cents earnings per common share was up 40% since the prior year. Furthermore, Ares closed a $667 million commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, with firmed up funding on 23 senior loans. On the dividend front, Ares declared in December its 4Q20 dividend. The payment, at 33 cents per common share, was paid out on January 15 – and is fully covered by current income levels. At current rates, the dividend annualizes to $1.32 and gives an impressive yield of 10.50%. Among the bulls is Hayes, who wrote: “We believe shares of ACRE are unfairly discounted relative to other commercial mREITs given strong Ares sponsorship, a very healthy balance sheet, and limited exposure to at-risk assets.” In his view, this leaves the company “well positioned to face the headwinds from COVID-19.” In line with these comments, Hayes rates ACRE a Buy, and his $13.50 price target implies a 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Only one other analyst has posted a recent ACRE review, also rating the stock a Buy, which makes the analyst consensus here a Moderate Buy. Shares are priced at $12.28, and their $12.75 average price target suggests room for modest ~4% growth. (See ACRE stock analysis on TipRanks) KKR Real Estate Finance Trust (KREF) Next up we have KKR, which operates in the commercial real estate sector, with almost half of its holdings in the states of New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The company both owns and finances commercial properties; 83% of its activities are with apartment dwellings and office spaces in desirable urban locations. KKR’s quality can be seen in the company’s quarterly results. The liquidity position was strong – KKR reported $700.6 million available at the end of 3Q20, the last quarter reported. The 56-cent EPS was up 7% sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. Further evidence of KKR’s sound position came at the beginning of January, when the announced it had closed 7 new commercial loans in Q4, totaling $565.4 million. This level of activity is a clear sign that KKR is recovering from the pandemic-related economic turndown. The solid foundation put the company in position to continue its dividend – which has been kept reliable for four years now. The most recent declaration, made in December, was for a 43-cent per common share dividend that was paid out in mid-January. That rate gives an annual payment of $1.72 per common share, and a robust yield of 9.7%. Covering KREF, Hayes is most impressed by the company’s move back toward proactive loan origination, saying, “We view 4Q20 origination activity to be in line with pre-pandemic production, and demonstrates a shift from “defense” to “offense” as transaction activity has picked up and the capital markets remain accommodative. We expect increased capital deployment to support earnings power and dividend coverage, and could potentially warrant an increase in the dividend as the macroeconomic outlook improves.” To this end, Hayes gives KREF a Buy and sets a $19.50 price target that indicates ~6% growth from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Wall Street has been keeping quiet on all things KREF, and the only other recent review also recommends a Buy. Put together, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at 19.26 and implies a modest ~5% upside. (See KREF stock analysis on TipRanks) Starwood Property Trust (STWD) For the third stock on Hayes’ list of picks, we turn to Starwood, a commercial mortgage REIT with a varied portfolio of first mortgages and mezzanine loans, in the $50 million to $500 million range. The company operates in the US and Europe, boasts a $5.9 billion market cap, and has offices in New York, London, and San Francisco. Starwood’s high-end portfolio has brought it solid earnings, even during the ‘corona recession’ of 2020. The company recorded $152 million in GAAP earnings for 3Q20, coming out to 53 cents per share, for gains of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. With that in the background, we can note the company’s dividend, which has been held steady at 48 cents per share for over two years. The last declaration was made in December, and the dividend was paid out on January 15. At the current rate, it annualizes to $1.92 and the yield is 9.23%. Once again, we’re looking at a stock that Hayes recommends to Buy. “We view STWD to be one of the few “blue chips” in the commercial mREIT sector given its size, liquidity, best-in-class management team, strong balance sheet, and diversified investment platform which has consistently generated stronger ROEs than peers. To that end, STWD is one of few commercial mREITs that neither restructured its liabilities with expensive rescue capital nor cut its dividend since the onset of COVID-19,” Hayes opined. Overall, there is little action on the Street heading STWD's way right now, with only one other analyst chiming in with a view on the company's prospects. An additional Buy rating means STWD qualifies as a Moderate Buy. However, the $21 average price target suggests shares will remain range bound for the foreseeable future.

The company has over $2 billion invested in 49 separate loans, 95% of which are senior mortgage loans. At the end of October, the company released 3Q20 earnings (the last reported quarter), showing $22.4 million in total revenue, for a 13% year-over-year gain. The 45-cents earnings per common share was up 40% since the prior year. Furthermore, Ares closed a $667 million commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, with firmed up funding on 23 senior loans. On the dividend front, Ares declared in December its 4Q20 dividend. The payment, at 33 cents per common share, was paid out on January 15 – and is fully covered by current income levels. At current rates, the dividend annualizes to $1.32 and gives an impressive yield of 10.50%. Among the bulls is Hayes, who wrote: “We believe shares of ACRE are unfairly discounted relative to other commercial mREITs given strong Ares sponsorship, a very healthy balance sheet, and limited exposure to at-risk assets.” In his view, this leaves the company “well positioned to face the headwinds from COVID-19.” In line with these comments, Hayes rates ACRE a Buy, and his $13.50 price target implies a 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Only one other analyst has posted a recent ACRE review, also rating the stock a Buy, which makes the analyst consensus here a Moderate Buy. Shares are priced at $12.28, and their $12.75 average price target suggests room for modest ~4% growth. (See ACRE stock analysis on TipRanks) KKR Real Estate Finance Trust (KREF) Next up we have KKR, which operates in the commercial real estate sector, with almost half of its holdings in the states of New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The company both owns and finances commercial properties; 83% of its activities are with apartment dwellings and office spaces in desirable urban locations. KKR’s quality can be seen in the company’s quarterly results. The liquidity position was strong – KKR reported $700.6 million available at the end of 3Q20, the last quarter reported. The 56-cent EPS was up 7% sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. Further evidence of KKR’s sound position came at the beginning of January, when the announced it had closed 7 new commercial loans in Q4, totaling $565.4 million. This level of activity is a clear sign that KKR is recovering from the pandemic-related economic turndown. The solid foundation put the company in position to continue its dividend – which has been kept reliable for four years now. The most recent declaration, made in December, was for a 43-cent per common share dividend that was paid out in mid-January. That rate gives an annual payment of $1.72 per common share, and a robust yield of 9.7%. Covering KREF, Hayes is most impressed by the company’s move back toward proactive loan origination, saying, “We view 4Q20 origination activity to be in line with pre-pandemic production, and demonstrates a shift from “defense” to “offense” as transaction activity has picked up and the capital markets remain accommodative. We expect increased capital deployment to support earnings power and dividend coverage, and could potentially warrant an increase in the dividend as the macroeconomic outlook improves.” To this end, Hayes gives KREF a Buy and sets a $19.50 price target that indicates ~6% growth from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Wall Street has been keeping quiet on all things KREF, and the only other recent review also recommends a Buy. Put together, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at 19.26 and implies a modest ~5% upside. (See KREF stock analysis on TipRanks) Starwood Property Trust (STWD) For the third stock on Hayes’ list of picks, we turn to Starwood, a commercial mortgage REIT with a varied portfolio of first mortgages and mezzanine loans, in the $50 million to $500 million range. The company operates in the US and Europe, boasts a $5.9 billion market cap, and has offices in New York, London, and San Francisco. Starwood’s high-end portfolio has brought it solid earnings, even during the ‘corona recession’ of 2020. The company recorded $152 million in GAAP earnings for 3Q20, coming out to 53 cents per share, for gains of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. With that in the background, we can note the company’s dividend, which has been held steady at 48 cents per share for over two years. The last declaration was made in December, and the dividend was paid out on January 15. At the current rate, it annualizes to $1.92 and the yield is 9.23%. Once again, we’re looking at a stock that Hayes recommends to Buy. “We view STWD to be one of the few “blue chips” in the commercial mREIT sector given its size, liquidity, best-in-class management team, strong balance sheet, and diversified investment platform which has consistently generated stronger ROEs than peers. To that end, STWD is one of few commercial mREITs that neither restructured its liabilities with expensive rescue capital nor cut its dividend since the onset of COVID-19,” Hayes opined. Overall, there is little action on the Street heading STWD's way right now, with only one other analyst chiming in with a view on the company's prospects. An additional Buy rating means STWD qualifies as a Moderate Buy. However, the $21 average price target suggests shares will remain range bound for the foreseeable future.

Speaking before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on October 15, 2007, investing guru John Bogle laid out the case: “Over the past 81 years… reinvested dividend income accounted for approximately 95 percent of the compound long-term return earned by the companies in the S&P 500. These stunning figures would seem to demand that mutual funds highlight the importance of dividend income.” So in other words, dividends are pretty important! Of course, right now the average stock on the S&P 500 is only paying about a 2% dividend yield, which isn’t a lot. If you want to do better than that, though, the REIT sector is a great place to begin your search for high-yield dividend stocks. REITs are companies that acquire, own, operate, and manage real estate portfolios, usually some combination of residential or commercial real properties, or their associated mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Tax law requires that these companies return profits directly to shareholders, and most of them choose dividends as their vehicle of choice for compliance, resulting in frequent high dividend yields across the sector. The slowly ebbing COVID pandemic was hard on real estate managers, as tenants had trouble making rents and owners had trouble leasing vacant space. However, BTIG analyst Tim Hayes believes there are reasons to stay bullish on CRE properties specifically. \"While we recognize the headwinds to commercial real estate (CRE) fundamentals and the potential risk to equity/earnings power, we believe there are several reasons to be constructive, especially with the sector trading at a discount to historical levels and offering attractive dividend yields at wide spreads to benchmark rates,\" Hayes commented.

The slowly ebbing COVID pandemic was hard on real estate managers, as tenants had trouble making rents and owners had trouble leasing vacant space. However, BTIG analyst Tim Hayes believes there are reasons to stay bullish on CRE properties specifically. \"While we recognize the headwinds to commercial real estate (CRE) fundamentals and the potential risk to equity/earnings power, we believe there are several reasons to be constructive, especially with the sector trading at a discount to historical levels and offering attractive dividend yields at wide spreads to benchmark rates,\" Hayes commented. Against this backdrop, we’ve opened up the TipRanks database to get the latest stats on Hayes’ CRE choices. These are stocks that the analyst initiated Buy ratings on, pointing out their high dividend yield. We are talking about at least 9% here. Ares Commercial Real Estate (ACRE) The first dividend pick we are looking at is Ares Commercial Real Estate, a company focused on the commercial real estate mortgage sector. Ares boasts a diversified portfolio – featuring office space, apartments, hotels, and mixed-use properties – mainly across the Southeast and West. The company has over $2 billion invested in 49 separate loans, 95% of which are senior mortgage loans. At the end of October, the company released 3Q20 earnings (the last reported quarter), showing $22.4 million in total revenue, for a 13% year-over-year gain. The 45-cents earnings per common share was up 40% since the prior year. Furthermore, Ares closed a $667 million commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, with firmed up funding on 23 senior loans. On the dividend front, Ares declared in December its 4Q20 dividend. The payment, at 33 cents per common share, was paid out on January 15 – and is fully covered by current income levels. At current rates, the dividend annualizes to $1.32 and gives an impressive yield of 10.50%. Among the bulls is Hayes, who wrote: “We believe shares of ACRE are unfairly discounted relative to other commercial mREITs given strong Ares sponsorship, a very healthy balance sheet, and limited exposure to at-risk assets.” In his view, this leaves the company “well positioned to face the headwinds from COVID-19.” In line with these comments, Hayes rates ACRE a Buy, and his $13.50 price target implies a 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Only one other analyst has posted a recent ACRE review, also rating the stock a Buy, which makes the analyst consensus here a Moderate Buy. Shares are priced at $12.28, and their $12.75 average price target suggests room for modest ~4% growth. (See ACRE stock analysis on TipRanks) KKR Real Estate Finance Trust (KREF) Next up we have KKR, which operates in the commercial real estate sector, with almost half of its holdings in the states of New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The company both owns and finances commercial properties; 83% of its activities are with apartment dwellings and office spaces in desirable urban locations. KKR’s quality can be seen in the company’s quarterly results. The liquidity position was strong – KKR reported $700.6 million available at the end of 3Q20, the last quarter reported. The 56-cent EPS was up 7% sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. Further evidence of KKR’s sound position came at the beginning of January, when the announced it had closed 7 new commercial loans in Q4, totaling $565.4 million. This level of activity is a clear sign that KKR is recovering from the pandemic-related economic turndown. The solid foundation put the company in position to continue its dividend – which has been kept reliable for four years now. The most recent declaration, made in December, was for a 43-cent per common share dividend that was paid out in mid-January. That rate gives an annual payment of $1.72 per common share, and a robust yield of 9.7%. Covering KREF, Hayes is most impressed by the company’s move back toward proactive loan origination, saying, “We view 4Q20 origination activity to be in line with pre-pandemic production, and demonstrates a shift from “defense” to “offense” as transaction activity has picked up and the capital markets remain accommodative. We expect increased capital deployment to support earnings power and dividend coverage, and could potentially warrant an increase in the dividend as the macroeconomic outlook improves.” To this end, Hayes gives KREF a Buy and sets a $19.50 price target that indicates ~6% growth from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Wall Street has been keeping quiet on all things KREF, and the only other recent review also recommends a Buy. Put together, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at 19.26 and implies a modest ~5% upside. (See KREF stock analysis on TipRanks) Starwood Property Trust (STWD) For the third stock on Hayes’ list of picks, we turn to Starwood, a commercial mortgage REIT with a varied portfolio of first mortgages and mezzanine loans, in the $50 million to $500 million range. The company operates in the US and Europe, boasts a $5.9 billion market cap, and has offices in New York, London, and San Francisco. Starwood’s high-end portfolio has brought it solid earnings, even during the ‘corona recession’ of 2020. The company recorded $152 million in GAAP earnings for 3Q20, coming out to 53 cents per share, for gains of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. With that in the background, we can note the company’s dividend, which has been held steady at 48 cents per share for over two years. The last declaration was made in December, and the dividend was paid out on January 15. At the current rate, it annualizes to $1.92 and the yield is 9.23%. Once again, we’re looking at a stock that Hayes recommends to Buy. “We view STWD to be one of the few “blue chips” in the commercial mREIT sector given its size, liquidity, best-in-class management team, strong balance sheet, and diversified investment platform which has consistently generated stronger ROEs than peers. To that end, STWD is one of few commercial mREITs that neither restructured its liabilities with expensive rescue capital nor cut its dividend since the onset of COVID-19,” Hayes opined. Overall, there is little action on the Street heading STWD's way right now, with only one other analyst chiming in with a view on the company's prospects. An additional Buy rating means STWD qualifies as a Moderate Buy. However, the $21 average price target suggests shares will remain range bound for the foreseeable future.

Speaking before the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on October 15, 2007, investing guru John Bogle laid out the case: “Over the past 81 years… reinvested dividend income accounted for approximately 95 percent of the compound long-term return earned by the companies in the S&P 500. These stunning figures would seem to demand that mutual funds highlight the importance of dividend income.” So in other words, dividends are pretty important! Of course, right now the average stock on the S&P 500 is only paying about a 2% dividend yield, which isn’t a lot. If you want to do better than that, though, the REIT sector is a great place to begin your search for high-yield dividend stocks. REITs are companies that acquire, own, operate, and manage real estate portfolios, usually some combination of residential or commercial real properties, or their associated mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Tax law requires that these companies return profits directly to shareholders, and most of them choose dividends as their vehicle of choice for compliance, resulting in frequent high dividend yields across the sector. The slowly ebbing COVID pandemic was hard on real estate managers, as tenants had trouble making rents and owners had trouble leasing vacant space. However, BTIG analyst Tim Hayes believes there are reasons to stay bullish on CRE properties specifically. \"While we recognize the headwinds to commercial real estate (CRE) fundamentals and the potential risk to equity/earnings power, we believe there are several reasons to be constructive, especially with the sector trading at a discount to historical levels and offering attractive dividend yields at wide spreads to benchmark rates,\" Hayes commented. Against this backdrop, we’ve opened up the TipRanks database to get the latest stats on Hayes’ CRE choices. These are stocks that the analyst initiated Buy ratings on, pointing out their high dividend yield. We are talking about at least 9% here. Ares Commercial Real Estate (ACRE) The first dividend pick we are looking at is Ares Commercial Real Estate, a company focused on the commercial real estate mortgage sector. Ares boasts a diversified portfolio – featuring office space, apartments, hotels, and mixed-use properties – mainly across the Southeast and West. The company has over $2 billion invested in 49 separate loans, 95% of which are senior mortgage loans. At the end of October, the company released 3Q20 earnings (the last reported quarter), showing $22.4 million in total revenue, for a 13% year-over-year gain. The 45-cents earnings per common share was up 40% since the prior year. Furthermore, Ares closed a $667 million commercial real estate collateralized loan obligation, with firmed up funding on 23 senior loans. On the dividend front, Ares declared in December its 4Q20 dividend. The payment, at 33 cents per common share, was paid out on January 15 – and is fully covered by current income levels. At current rates, the dividend annualizes to $1.32 and gives an impressive yield of 10.50%. Among the bulls is Hayes, who wrote: “We believe shares of ACRE are unfairly discounted relative to other commercial mREITs given strong Ares sponsorship, a very healthy balance sheet, and limited exposure to at-risk assets.” In his view, this leaves the company “well positioned to face the headwinds from COVID-19.” In line with these comments, Hayes rates ACRE a Buy, and his $13.50 price target implies a 10% upside from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Only one other analyst has posted a recent ACRE review, also rating the stock a Buy, which makes the analyst consensus here a Moderate Buy. Shares are priced at $12.28, and their $12.75 average price target suggests room for modest ~4% growth. (See ACRE stock analysis on TipRanks) KKR Real Estate Finance Trust (KREF) Next up we have KKR, which operates in the commercial real estate sector, with almost half of its holdings in the states of New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The company both owns and finances commercial properties; 83% of its activities are with apartment dwellings and office spaces in desirable urban locations. KKR’s quality can be seen in the company’s quarterly results. The liquidity position was strong – KKR reported $700.6 million available at the end of 3Q20, the last quarter reported. The 56-cent EPS was up 7% sequentially, and 36% year-over-year. Further evidence of KKR’s sound position came at the beginning of January, when the announced it had closed 7 new commercial loans in Q4, totaling $565.4 million. This level of activity is a clear sign that KKR is recovering from the pandemic-related economic turndown. The solid foundation put the company in position to continue its dividend – which has been kept reliable for four years now. The most recent declaration, made in December, was for a 43-cent per common share dividend that was paid out in mid-January. That rate gives an annual payment of $1.72 per common share, and a robust yield of 9.7%. Covering KREF, Hayes is most impressed by the company’s move back toward proactive loan origination, saying, “We view 4Q20 origination activity to be in line with pre-pandemic production, and demonstrates a shift from “defense” to “offense” as transaction activity has picked up and the capital markets remain accommodative. We expect increased capital deployment to support earnings power and dividend coverage, and could potentially warrant an increase in the dividend as the macroeconomic outlook improves.” To this end, Hayes gives KREF a Buy and sets a $19.50 price target that indicates ~6% growth from current levels. (To watch Hayes’ track record, click here) Wall Street has been keeping quiet on all things KREF, and the only other recent review also recommends a Buy. Put together, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Meanwhile, the average price target stands at 19.26 and implies a modest ~5% upside. (See KREF stock analysis on TipRanks) Starwood Property Trust (STWD) For the third stock on Hayes’ list of picks, we turn to Starwood, a commercial mortgage REIT with a varied portfolio of first mortgages and mezzanine loans, in the $50 million to $500 million range. The company operates in the US and Europe, boasts a $5.9 billion market cap, and has offices in New York, London, and San Francisco. Starwood’s high-end portfolio has brought it solid earnings, even during the ‘corona recession’ of 2020. The company recorded $152 million in GAAP earnings for 3Q20, coming out to 53 cents per share, for gains of 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. With that in the background, we can note the company’s dividend, which has been held steady at 48 cents per share for over two years. The last declaration was made in December, and the dividend was paid out on January 15. At the current rate, it annualizes to $1.92 and the yield is 9.23%. Once again, we’re looking at a stock that Hayes recommends to Buy. “We view STWD to be one of the few “blue chips” in the commercial mREIT sector given its size, liquidity, best-in-class management team, strong balance sheet, and diversified investment platform which has consistently generated stronger ROEs than peers. To that end, STWD is one of few commercial mREITs that neither restructured its liabilities with expensive rescue capital nor cut its dividend since the onset of COVID-19,” Hayes opined. Overall, there is little action on the Street heading STWD's way right now, with only one other analyst chiming in with a view on the company's prospects. An additional Buy rating means STWD qualifies as a Moderate Buy. However, the $21 average price target suggests shares will remain range bound for the foreseeable future.

            "Text": "Alibaba BABA is the value needle in a haystack of stretched tech valuations. The stock has upward momentum on its side, and after a robust earnings report this morning, I wouldn't hesitate to jump on this long-term opportunity for the Amazon of the East.\n\nChina's challenging regulatory system flexed its muscles this November, and the subsequent disappearance of Jack Ma, catalyzing a cascade of year end sell-offs. Now BABA is headed back up towards $300, with China's economy surging into 2021 (the only country with a positive GDP in 2020), Ma's reappearance, and a very healthy Q4 earnings report.\n\nThe Earnings Report\n\nThe company beat analysts' estimates on every metric, with its leading cloud division turning an operational profit for the first time. This innovation-driven business continues to impress me, illustrating 37% topline growth with its proliferating cloud segment expanding by 50% year-over-year. Singles Day (11.11) was the biggest in history for the company, helping boost its topline to record levels.\n\nBABA shares sold off 3% from these positive earnings, which appears to be a trend for the tech sector's highly anticipated year-end reports. Traders are buying the rumor of expected strong earnings, and when the great quarterly results are released, they are selling the news.\n\nAmazon AMZN is expected to report record sales in its Q4 earnings report after the bell today, and if its Asian counterpart is any indication of what is to come, I expect strong results. According to Zacks Consensus estimates, analysts anticipate AMZN to report an EPS of $7.05 on sales of $120.36 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 9% and 38%, respectively.\n\nIf recent tech earnings trends continued (buy the earnings rumor and sell the earnings news), I would hesitate to make any AMZN purchases going into this evening's earnings report.\n\nThe Big BABA Sell-Off\n\nIt started with Jack Ma's public criticism of the Chinese government and its financial system. Xi's communist regime did not appreciate the critique and retaliated in full force.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first week of November, Chinese officials suspended what was expected to be the largest IPO in public equity history. Ant Group is the shining star of China's fintech space, and Alibaba holds a 33% stake in this innovative financial behemoth.\n\nChinese regulators have been probing Ant's micro-loan business since the fintech powerhouse began preparing its shares for its public debut. Two days before the anticipated IPO, Ant's listing was suspended, citing a change in China's fintech regulations.\n\nThen in the domino effect of Jack Ma's regretful critiques, regulators released draft-rules on Wednesday concerning anti-competitive behavior, seemingly targeting Alibaba. Leading to another share price drop off.\n\nChina regulators are sending a wake-up call to Jack Ma and the rest of the Chinese tech industry to who is running the show. Xi's administration felt that Jack Ma's economic influence (Alibaba & Ant Group) challenged the country's power and control.\n\nThe BABA Opportunity\n\nAt the end of the day, China has no intention of destroying its most profitable tech giant. This was more of a powerplay by Chinese regulators to remind its domestic tech titans who really holds the cards.\n\nBABA shares whiplash sell-off has created a fantastic opportunity to purchase one of Asia's highest potential enterprises at a substantial discount. From a technical and fundamental point of view, this stock is a buy.\n\nBABA is currently trading in a Fibonacci bound range between $265 and $252 (which you can see circled in red below). Today's earnings profit pull sent the stock tumbling down to its 50-day moving average at around $254.50, then quickly bounced back. This is a tremendous opportunity to buy BABA at a discount before it breaks out of its current range, and after the amazing quarter it just released, I'm not sure how long it will remain this low.\n\nAlibaba has a cornucopia of digital products at its disposal, and it will use all of them to control and profit off the prolific digitalization occurring in Asia today.\n\nThe fact that the Amazon of the East (aka BABA) has not taken off like its western counterpart is baffling. Alibaba controls the e-commerce space (80% market share), the cloud-computing category (roughly 50% market share), and a 33% stake in the leading FinTech in the most populous and soon-to-be largest economy on Earth.\n\nAlibaba is valued at less than half of Amazon despite producing substantially wider margins, greater profitability, and having a more extensive revenue growth outlook for the next couple of years.\n\nBABA was undervalued before this end of year sell-off. Today the stock is a stronger buy than ever, with options activity pointing to a swift recovery and 15 out of 16 analysts calling this a buy today.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nBABA still has a massive amount of upside potential waiting to be priced in. The Chinese economy is beginning to recover beyond pre-COVID growth rates, with Alibaba's digital technology being the centerpiece of this expansion.\n\nAnt's IPO delay and the anti-competitive probe are just a small hiccup in Alibaba's tech dominance in the East. BABA's post-earnings drip presents us with a very savvy long-term buying opportunity.\n\nZacks Names “Single Best Pick to Double”\n\n\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\n\n\nYou know this company from its past glory days, but few would expect that it’s poised for a monster turnaround.

            "Date": "2021-02-02",
            "Headline": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights: Amazon, Alibaba, JD.com, ASOS and Jumia Technologies",
            "Text": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 2, 2021 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses e-Commerce including Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA, JD.com, Inc. JD, ASOS plc ASOMY and Jumia Technologies AG JMIA.\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1255200/3-stocks-with-promise-as-ecommerce-growth-drops-off-in-2021\n\nThe need for social distancing remains generally positive for the ecommerce segment, which includes pureplays as well as traditional retailers with ecommerce capabilities. However, estimates from the Commerce Department indicate that some of the traffic that moved online during the initial months of the pandemic is moving back to stores-\n\nAccordingly, ecommerce sales in the last quarter were 36.7% above 3Q19 (down 1% sequentially), with total retail sales increasing 7.0% (up 12.0% sequentially). Ecommerce accounted for over 14.3% of total U.S. retail sales (it was 20%+ in the second quarter).\n\nDespite these stats, there's evidence that the race to digitization is accelerating, consumer habits are altering for good and supply chains are adjusting to help the two sides meet.\n\nGiven the very strong growth in 2020, we could expect flat to slightly down earnings this year because of more difficult comps. Certain names that still stand out are JD.com, ASOS plc, Jumia Tech, Monotaro and Overstock.com.\n\nAbout the Industry\n\nElectronic-commerce, the method of buying and selling goods and services via a software platform, continues to evolve as the technologies driving it get more advanced.\n\nOn the one side are user devices, which are getting bigger, brighter and more capable. Voice-controlled devices like smartwatches and smart home devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home and Apple HomePod are joining these to facilitate conversational commerce.\n\nOn the other side are the software platforms facilitating the transaction, which are getting AI-enabled, sometimes including AR/VR and getting generally more sophisticated, and therefore, more capable of delivering a satisfying user experience. Social commerce is developing into a major trend as are chatbots that facilitate back-end operations and customer care.\n\nStory continues\n\nDifferentiation in the industry comes from better technology for improved showcasing, easier navigation and payment, speedier delivery and returns, brand building, comparison shopping, loyalty and so forth, which generally tip the scale in favor of larger players. Particularly because there is fierce price competition necessitating deep discounting, which keeps prices down.\n\nA peculiarity of the market is Amazon's complete dominance in the U.S. and its growing presence in other important markets. This is driving some traditional players to partner with Amazon. Chinese companies Alibaba and JD.com are other significant players.\n\nFactors Shaping the Future of the Internet-Commerce industry:\n\nThe pandemic has proved extremely beneficial for ecommerce players, and not just because of the government-mandated stay-home orders that led to soaring business volumes. Markets have been open across the country for a couple of quarters now, but purchasing trends haven't gone back to where they were before. Just like many companies temporarily adopting work-from-home practices are expected to make it a broader trend, many shoppers are also likely to keep away from stores, at least until a broader vaccination of the population. One thing this trend should boost (if technology companies are up to it) is the adoption of AR/VR technology because of its potential to greatly enhance showcasing. The technology is already being leveraged very effectively in the housing market. Also, the ability to fit things like furniture or other items where people want it in their homes is better even than physical retail. More stores will likely be converted into delivery hubs to facilitate this trend.\n\nAs American companies like Amazon and Walmart continue their march to conquer the world, it's relevant for this outlook to include data that goes beyond the borders. So, according to eMarketer's projections, global retail ecommerce is expected to decelerate from 27.6% growth in 2020 to 14.3% growth in 2021 even as total retail sales go from down 3.0% to up 5.1%. The U.S. piece of ecommerce is expected to go from 32.4% growth last year to 6.1% this year while total retail improves from a decline of 3.2% to an increase of 1.6%. The categories experiencing strongest ecommerce growth in 2020 include consumer electronics; furniture and home furnishings; health, personal care & beauty; and food and beverages. The categories experiencing weakness include all kinds of traditional retail; auto, which however picked up quite strongly in the second half; all kinds of online booking for public travel and hospitality, hitting companies like Expedia and TripAdvisor; and apparel, which was however stronger than initially expected. This year, traditional retailers will double down on digital initiatives including click and collect, cashierless checkout, contactless payment and digital signage while online retailers focus on social commerce, grocery sales and the buy-now-pay-later option.\n\nBoth ecommerce pureplays and traditional retailers branching into ecommerce are seeing a surge in ecommerce sales. However, physical presence remains important because it is only proximity to a consumer that can facilitate quick delivery. So the trend moving retailers toward a hybrid/omnichannel model that customers can get quick delivery from, or from where they can pick up the items ordered online (BOPIS, curbside pickup), at their convenience, and through apps arranging personal shoppers, is likely to remain. Self-driven delivery vehicles and drones are already on the horizon to deal with logistics problems and make deliveries smoother and cheaper.\n\nAlso, data mining has never been easier. Because of the many details involved in satisfying a customer, data mining has grown in importance over the years, with the party controlling the customer's data being best positioned to identify and service demand while also delivering the desired experience. Most of the big ecommerce players are also into payments processing, which gives them further insight into a customer's tastes, preferences and buying habits. As machines read and process this data, they can create programs and processes to maximize customer satisfaction and drive sales. Artificial intelligence such as that used by companies like Amazon already decides how competitive a player is. But in the not-too-distant future, more and more retailers will jump on board and harnessing big data will become imperative for survival.\n\nAll said, revenue growth rates may be expected to remain very strong as a result of more companies moving online and existing players utilizing more advanced tools and analytics to increase their return on investment. But profitability could come in for some pressure (for some) as companies invest heavily in building out infrastructure to support the strong revenue growth and also comply with safety guidelines. Experiential retail is also likely to be an important area of investment for retailers.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Reflects The Strong Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry is a rather large group within the broader Zacks Retail And Wholesale Sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #199, which places it at the bottom 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. So the group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates strong near-term prospects.\n\nThe industry's positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of its relative performance versus others. As far as aggregate estimate revisions are concerned, it appears that analysts expect earnings to decline this year and the next on revenue that will be down slightly this year but grow strongly in the next.\n\nThe net decline in the 2021 and 2022 earnings estimates are 30.5% and 23.0%. The net decline in the revenue estimate for 2021 is 1.0% and the net increase for 2022 is 7.1%. The delta is likely attributable to increased cost of operation and amortization and other charges related to infrastructure buildup.\n\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Leads On Shareholder Returns\n\nThe Zacks Electronic - Commerce Industry is trading at a premium to both the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\n\nSo we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 42.7% over the past year, compared to the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale Sector's 33.6% and the Zacks S&P 500 Composite's 15.9%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which is a more appropriate valuation criterion in the current situation, we see that the industry is currently trading at a 4.53X multiple, higher than the S&P 500's 4.49X and understandably higher than the sector's forward-12-month P/S of 1.32X.\n\nOver the past year, the industry has traded as high as 5.69X, as low as 4.00X and at the median of 4.82X.\n\n3 Stocks Standing Out\n\nJD.com: Through its website www.jd.com and mobile applications, JD offers a broad selection of products to customers in China. The company is the second largest ecommerce company in China after Alibaba.\n\nJD's leadership in the fragmented and fast-growing Chinese ecommerce market, the breadth of its products and particular strength in electronics, continued innovation and ability to cater to strong demand following the pandemic are expected to generate very strong results in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up a penny in the last 30 days.\n\nThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is up 126.2% over the past year.\n\nASOS: This is a British provider of fashion goods including womenswear and menswear, footwear, accessories, jewelry and beauty and grooming products that are sold through its website, asos.com. It operates in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, the U.S., Russia and China.\n\nThe company has recently picked up the famous Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge brands from Arcadia, which went out of business. ASOS has also seen the same pandemic-driven surge in its results that other ecommerce players in the U.S. have seen. While the company is well positioned for growth this year, it primarily caters to young adults in their twenties, and there is some pandemic-driven unemployment risk in this group.\n\nThis Zacks Rank #2 company's current year EPS estimate up 16.1% in the last 30 days.\n\nIts shares are up 50.8% over the past year.\n\nJumia Technologies: Jumia is a German online retailer of dresses, leggings, skirts, polo shirts, belts, watches, sunglasses, health products, beauty products and a range of products for children, among other things to a number of countries in Africa.\n\nThe main positive for this company is its first-mover advantage in Africa, where there are a number of emerging economies. However, infrastructure isn't the same as it is in the U.S. or Western Europe, so there are also challenges to its becoming the \"Amazon of Africa\" as it has often been referred to. The pandemic hasn't moved the needle for Jumia in 2020, but this year could be different since there has been a resurgence in important markets like South Africa and Nigeria.\n\nThe company is yet to turn in a profit, but its per share loss for 2021 is down 1 cents in the last 60 days. It's also down 38 cents from the estimated loss for 2020.\n\nThe shares are up 920.4% from last year and a short squeeze could be brewing.\n\nLegal Marijuana: An Investor's Dream\n\nImagine getting in early on a young industry primed to skyrocket from $17.7 billion in 2019 to an expected $73.6 billion by 2027.\n\nAlthough marijuana stocks did better as the pandemic took hold than the market as a whole, they've been pushed down.

            "Headline": "Earnings roundup: Alibaba beats, Harley-Davidson posts surprise loss",
            "Text": "Julie Hyman, Myles Udland and Brian Sozzi discuss some of Tuesday morning’s early movers, including Alibaba — which topped estimates — as well as Harley-Davidson — which posted an expected loss as the company unveils a turnaround plan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Let's talk about some of the earnings that came out this morning and are seeing some notable moves in the market. One of them is Alibaba, of course the Chinese giant e-commerce company. The company said revenue was up by 37%.\n\nAnd Alibaba's numbers tend to look good on the face of it. They had strong results, they said, from Singles Day. They sort of extended the promotions from that. That's similar to what we saw for Amazon and its Prime promotion event.\n\nBut, you know, most of this is being overshadowed by the regulatory situation and what's going on in China, Myles, with its Ant subsidiary, with Jack Ma, and with threats of regulation for this company and also its pulled listing.\n\nMYLES UDLAND: Yeah, I mean, I think-- look, Alibaba has a fine business in its own right that I think people are excited about, but certainly its, you know, 1/3 stake in Ant was a part of the company's value. And the company coming out and saying, you know, on the call that they don't really know what's going on right now or they're not able to provide an update, rather, to the markets-- all they said is the, you know, IPO process for Ant is subject to, quote, \"substantial uncertainties.\" I would certainly say so when the Chinese government comes in and decides that Ant Group is not going to be able to-- I don't know, I guess upend and, you know, kind of be the main player within China's emerging fintech scene.\n\nAlso, this comes as news or, rather, a lack of news came out that China listed some of its tech luminaries-- out with a big, you know, splashy advertisement for this. Jack Ma not a part of that.\n\nSo the relationship between Alibaba, between Jack Ma, between Ant, between the Chinese government, certainly there was always some level of it being fraught because no one comes before the party, at least not anyone that, you know, Xi hasn't endorsed as being able to come before the party. But again, that would ultimately be no one comes before the party.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd so a very strange dynamic developed there with Ma's wealth, his, you know, public appearances, the way that he spoke. Certainly we covered at length his comments he made last fall speaking negatively about Chinese financial regulations, the way there's been a crackdown on him and now his businesses, and that really remains the big story here and what, you know, US-China relations look like now that Donald Trump is not the president. We no longer have trade war by tweet, but it's not like everything is now all hunky dory with US-China relations as China worries about, you know, I guess we could say displeasure within its own business ranks.\n\nSo very interesting and strange geopolitical, you know, business-political story, however you want to exactly phrase it. And I think, again, certainly overshadows what was, to no one's surprise, a very strong year for the e-commerce company.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, so this is obviously much more complex than just the earnings. A story that seems a lot more straightforward is that involving Harley-Davidson, which reported an unexpected loss. The company has also, Brian, come out with a turnaround plan over the next five years, but it's had some turnaround plans before. Unclear what's going to be different this time. Look at that stock. Woo, down 18% here.\n\nBRIAN SOZZI: Yeah, Julia, I've followed Harley-Davidson for a good number of years, and there's been a lot of internal change at this company. I would say morale, just based on my conversations with folks familiar with the matter-- the culture inside has really taken a hit during these challenging times, and it really-- the morale is low, I would say, right now at Harley-Davidson.\n\nAnd what you're seeing today here is a stunning quarter by one of the most widely recognized consumer brands in the world. Of note, they came out on the press release, Harley-Davidson this morning. They said they cut models, the number of models, by 30%. Dealer inventory down 59%. The core motorcycle division for Harley-Davidson lost $196 million in terms of operating profits.\n\nWhat you're seeing, this is the reflection of really a review process by new CEO Jochen Zeitz who officially took over in May of last year. But he's been on the board since 2007, so he's very familiar with the company. He has hit the complete reset button on this company to really bring out a lot of costs from the business, get when they release bikes out on a better trajectory and just release hopefully more profitable bikes.\n\nAnd his five-year plan is called Hardwire, and I think it really revolves around doing less and hopefully making more money per bike. But it doesn't change the structural problem in the bike industry, guys, that people aren't just buying bikes. Look, we just had Brunswick's CEO on, David Foulkes. People are buying boats. It's just the bike industry that remains very challenged.\n\nI know our producer Nick Monte is sad about that, but that's just the reality of it. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, and I don't know what gets people to buy more motorcycles. It's not necessarily a new Harley-Davidson electric bike.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, Nick will still be able to buy his bike, so that's all right. By the way, Harley has also said it's offering an equity grant to 4,500 employees. So in other words, buyouts to employees to cut those jobs."

[Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rob Lin, head of investor relations of Alibaba Group.\n\nPlease go ahead.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you.

All translations are for convenience purpose only. In the case of any discrepancy, management's statement in the original language will prevail. With that, I will now turn over to Daniel.\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks, Rob. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our earnings call today. Alibaba Group delivered another strong quarter.\n\nOur revenue increased 37% year over year to reach RMB 221 billion, while adjusted EBITDA increased 21% year over year to reach RMB 61.3 billion. Annual active consumers and GMV of our China retail marketplaces continue to enjoy healthy growth with Taobao Deals suppressing 100 million mobile MAUs for the first time. We celebrated another milestone with Alibaba Cloud, which achieved its first profitable quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA. These business trends are all quite encouraging and are supported by a China economy that has recovered rapidly from the pandemic.\n\nMaggie will provide more details on our operating and financial performance in a few minutes. I would like to address another subject that everyone is equally focused on, which is the potential impact of China's changing regulatory environment on Internet platform companies. I will share the latest updates on this topic. This past quarter, Alibaba experienced the suspicion of Ant Group's IPO due to change in the fintech regulatory environment, as well as the initiation of an antimonopoly investigation by regulators in China.\n\nOn December 24, 2020, Alibaba Group received a notice of an investigation from the State Administration for Market Regulation, or SAMR, that it has commenced an investigation pursuant to the PRC Antimonopoly Law. The investigation is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the SAMR. We have established a special task force with leaders from our relevant business units to conduct internal reviews. We will continue to actively communicate with the SAMR on compliance with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe will further update the market when the investigation is concluded. We approach this antimonopoly investigation with a cooperative, receptive and open mindset. As a China retail marketplace connecting hundreds of millions of consumers and millions of merchants in transactions valued in trillions of RMB, we have a deep appreciation of the significant social and public responsibilities of operating our platform. Beyond complying with regulatory requirements, we will continue to do our best to fulfill our responsibilities to society and continue our causes, such as consumer protection, digitalization of retail and industrial upgrading.\n\nRegarding Ant Group, as you know, in early November, Ant Group announced the suspension of its proposed dual listing and initial public offering on the Shanghai Stock Exchange STAR board and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Due to recent significant change in the fintech regulatory environment in China, Ant Group is in the process of developing its ratification plan, which will need to go through the relevant regulatory procedures. Therefore, Ant Group's business prospects and IPO plans are subject to substantial uncertainties. Currently, we are unable to make a complete and fair assessment of the impact that these changes and uncertainties will have on Alibaba Group.\n\nWe will update the market when -- once Ant Group has completed the relevant regulatory procedures for its ratification plan. We received questions regarding whether any potential reduction in available consumer credit where Ant Group offerings, such as Huabei, would impact consumer spending on our China retail marketplaces. I want to highlight that the availability of credit is not a major reason that motivates consumers to shop on our China retail marketplaces. They are attracted by our comprehensive and high-quality product and service offerings, our competitive pricing and our ability to satisfy and stimulate consumption needs.\n\nPayments using Huabei on our China retail marketplaces only represent a very small percentage of total credit granted under Huabei, and the vast majority of our consumers have linked their payment accounts to multiple funding sources, including credit cards. And Huabei is only one of the funding channels. Although the changing regulatory landscape applicable to fintech and Internet platform companies present near-term challenge to Alibaba, we regard this as important opportunities for reassessing and improving our business practices. In this highly competitive market environment, we will further challenge ourselves to constantly deliver and enhance value creation for customers through innovation.\n\nIn multiple areas, such as China commerce retail, local services, cloud computing and international commerce, we see challenges and fierce competition, but also tremendous potential. Looking forward, we will be even more committed to investing in these core areas, investing for innovation, for value creation and for long-term growth. Here, I will elaborate a little bit more on our thinking in four core areas. First, in China retail marketplaces, we will continue our user acquisition efforts, especially in less developed areas.\n\nWe will build on Taobao Deals 100 million mobile MAU base and further invest in expansion of the user base and the product supplies targeting less developed area -- markets. In addition, in the community group purchase space, we are developing a unique model based on consumer value proposition as opposed to subsidization to ensure good consumer experience and a business sustainability. Second, our local service flagship, Ele.me, will continue to strengthen its partnership with Alipay to expand location-based on-demand delivery services to additional categories beyond the meals such as groceries and pharmaceuticals. On-demand deliveries of non-meal categories are growing rapidly on Ele.me, which shows significant market potential.\n\nThe current regulatory trend toward more healthy competition will benefit all market participants as consumers and merchants look for diversified supply. We will leverage this opportunity to continue investing to strengthen our local service business. Third, in cloud computing, we are pleased to have delivered our first quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. This is the result of years of investment in pursuit of long-term value creation.\n\nAlibaba Cloud continues to grow at a rapid rate with 50% revenue growth year over year in December quarter, reflecting the massive potential of China's cloud computing market. We believe the market is still at an early stage as data intelligence applications and the demand for computing power will become universal across all industry sectors. We will leverage Alibaba's unique advantage in technology and data intelligence applications while continuing to invest for growth. Finally, for globalization, Southeast Asia, which is a core market for our international commerce business, is witnessing Lazada's rapid growth in both user base and transaction volume.\n\nWe have spent several years upgrading Lazada's technology infrastructure, business model and operating efficiency. We believe we are now well positioned to capitalize on the Southeast Asia market, which is experiencing accelerated growth through further investment into long-term opportunity with the goal of increasing our market share and users' mind share. As China is fully evolving into a digital economy, Alibaba continues to be the best position in this historical transformation with our digital infrastructure in commerce, financial services, logistics and cloud computing that we have been building over the last 20 years. We continue to be confident about our three growth engines of domestic consumption, cutting-edge technology and globalization as these drivers are also consistent with China's policy direction in its economic development.\n\nThank you all. Now, I would like to turn it over to Maggie, who will walk you through the details of our financial results.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Daniel. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Let me start with financial highlights for the quarter. Our annual active consumer in our China retail marketplace reached 779 million, and mobile MAUs reached 902 million.\n\nSo both have shown net adds of over 20 million in the quarter's time. Our total revenue was RMB 221 billion, up 37% year on year. Starting from this quarter, we consolidated Sun Art, which is a newly acquired company. And if we take out the impact of Sun Art consolidation, the revenue growth will still show a strong growth of 27% year on year.\n\nOK. So this strong revenue growth, mainly coming from the strong growth of our core commerce business, as well as the strong revenue growth of our cloud computing business. Our adjusted EBITDA was RMB 68 billion, up 22% year on year, and adjusted EBITDA was RMB 61 billion, up 21% year on year, primarily driven by healthy profit growth of our core commerce segment. If taking out Sun Art, the adjusted EBITDA growth would have been 21% year over year.\n\nOur cloud computing business continued to deliver solid revenue growth of 50%. And we're very pleased that the adjusted EBITDA for AliCloud turned positive for the first time. We continue to maintain a strong cash position of USD 70 billion. Our non-GAAP free cash flow grew 23% year over year to RMB 96 billion during this quarter.\n\nLet's look at our cost trends for the quarter. Excluding SBC, total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue increased by three percentage points, mostly due to our investment in strategic important areas, which I'll talk about in detail later. Now, let's look at our long-term investment approach and how it drives behind our multi-engine growth driver. So this multi-engine growth driver actually is very unique for Alibaba if you compare to our peer companies.\n\nWe're the only one has so many -- all the building blocks for the core commerce, including all of these infrastructures. So our ecosystem has developed many growth businesses because of our focus on innovation and our steadfast approach of investing in our businesses for long term. Over the years, our businesses have become more diversified and more integrated as we provide more value-added service to merchants and businesses. The value we add is reflected not only in our original Taobao and Tmall business, but also in new retail, Cainiao, international commerce, local consumer service and cloud computing.\n\nWe categorized these businesses into three development phases of seed, traction and profitability as highlighted during the investor day back in September last year. So for instance, businesses such as Alibaba Cloud has graduated to profitability stage after over 10 years of investment. Several developing business within core commerce, such as Cainiao, have graduated into traction stage as they expand their addressable markets and gain scale of economy. So business in the profitability stage has never stopped innovating either.\n\nWithin the core commerce, we further invested in local service, new retail, logistics and globalization. Even within our core, core, which is the most profitable China retail marketplaces, we have also incubated and stepped up investments in new seed businesses such as Taobao Deals, Taobao Live, Taoxianda, Taobao Short Video and Taobao Grocery. These businesses address new consumption demand and behaviors and will continue to expand our addressable markets in China. Let's look at our core commerce segment.\n\nThe core commerce revenue grew 38% year on year to RMB 196 billion. Within the core commerce revenue, CMR grew 20% year on year to RMB 102 billion. Customer management revenue growth is driven by the solid growth of our China retail marketplace. Tmall online physical goods paid GMV grew 19%, mainly driven by rapid growth of FMCG and home furnishing category, as well as accelerated growth of consumer electronic categories.\n\nTaobao online physical goods paid GMV was also strong, which was driven by growth of apparel and accessories, home furnishing and consumer electronic categories. The success of the China retail marketplace is an increasing number of value-added services we provide to merchants, attracted increasing number of paying merchants and a higher average spending per merchant. CMR grew 20%. This is primarily due to the robust growth in revenue from new monetization formats such as recommendation fees, an increase in the average unit price per click in search monetization, as well as the fast growth of the Tmall online physical goods GMV.\n\nChina retail other revenue grew 100% year on year due to impact of Sun Art consolidation, strong growth of Tmall Supermarket. Taking out the impact from the consolidation Sun Art, China retail others revenue still growing over 40%. Cainiao logistics revenue grew 51% year on year, primarily driven by increase in volume of orders fulfilled from our fast-growing cross-border and international commerce retail businesses. International commerce retail grew 37%, primarily driven by robust growth of Lazada trend deal, as well as GMV recovery of AliExpress.\n\nLazada recorded another quarter of triple-digit order growth by ongoing market consolidation in Southeast China region. Local consumer service revenue grew 10% due to an increase in GMV, as well as more efficient use of subsidies. Core commerce adjusted EBITDA reached RMB 66 billion, growing at 15% year on year. Our original business in China retail marketplaces, including Taobao, Tmall, Alimama, this business continued to maintain strong adjusted EBITDA growth and stable margins during the quarter.\n\nAnd these trends were partially offset by increased investments in certain new businesses, such as Taobao Deal, Live and Taobao Groceries. Investments in these new seeds business will continue to enhance consumer experience and engagement, as well as helping increasing Alibaba ecosystems penetration into developing areas of China. After development business such as local consumer service, international commerce retail, new retail and direct import, logistics continued to show solid progress and improving operating efficiencies. The combined losses of these developing businesses narrowed by RMB 1.6 billion from RMB 8.3 billion to 6.7 billion.\n\nImportantly, we're also pleased that has Cainiao recorded positive operating cash flow after intercompany eliminations. Next, Alibaba Cloud continued to empower the digital transformation of enterprises by providing comprehensive technology solution and services in the cloud for wide range of industries. In December quarter, cloud computing revenue grew 50%, and this is primarily driven by robust growth in revenue from customers in Internet, retail and public sectors. After our continuous investment for years, AliCloud achieved a positive EBITDA growth, a positive EBITDA during the quarter.\n\nSo for DME, we continue to improve the operating efficiency through disciplined investment in content and production capability. During the quarter, adjusted EBITDA loss for this segment continued to narrow, primarily due to reduced losses in Youku and increased the contribution from our online game business. Let's take a look at revenue and adjusted EBITA growth for the first nine months of 2021. So this is important to note that our core commerce segment has many businesses that target the same consumer base in China.\n\nAs such, we take a holistic investment approach when allocating resources and capital across the segment by always reinvesting part of the incremental profit into new businesses. Despite increased investment in new businesses, our core commerce segment, excluding impact from Sun Art consolidation, achieved a robust revenue growth of 30%. This is for the year to date and how the -- adjusted EBITA growth of 19%. Our investments will continue to focus on increasing consumer base, improving user experience and enhancing supply chain logistic infrastructures.\n\nSelected financial metrics summary. So let's take a look at several items. One is the interest investment income, which was RMB 40 billion, shows a big year-on-year increase. The increase is primarily due to an increase in the net gain from increases in market prices or public equity investments.\n\nAnd share of results of equity method investees was a loss of RMB 3.6 billion. It is a result of a impairment loss recorded, which was partially offset by a RMB 4.8 billion in profit share of Ant Group September quarter's financial results. So we record these equity pickup one-quarter lag. Non-GAAP net income was RMB 59 billion, an increase of 27% year on year.\n\nCash flow and capex. For the quarter, free cash flow was RMB 96 billion, which increased 23%, mainly due to our robust profitability growth. And as of December 31, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were RMB 456 billion, approximately USD 70 billion. On December 28, our board of directors has authorized to upsize our share repurchase program from USD 6 billion to USD 10 billion.\n\nWe have commenced a share repurchase program during the quarter and repurchased around USD 118 million of ADS in this quarter. Let's take a look at -- have this outlook discussion. 2020 was an unprecedented year. A year has passed since the pandemic started, and it continues to create uncertainties and disruptions to business globally.\n\nGiven the Chinese government has taken effective measures to limit the spread of virus earlier, China's economy saw a quick recovery, which, in turn, supported the solid growth recovery of our business. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in user growth, user engagement, digital transformation of businesses and our people. In fiscal '21, we have started to increase spending in new business initiatives. In fiscal '22, we plan to step up our reinvestments of the incremental profits generated into our seed businesses and the strategic growth areas in order to create long-term value to our customers, employees and shareholders.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Let's open the floor for questions. Thank you.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. For today's call, you are welcome to ask questions in Chinese or English. A third-party translator will provide consecutive interpretation for the Q&A session, and our management will address your question in the language you asked. Please note that this translation is for convenience purpose only.\n\nIn the case of any discrepancy, our management statement in the original language will prevail. [Foreign language] So operator, please connect speaker and SI conference line now. And then, please start the Q&A session when we're ready. Thank you.\n\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. [Operator instructions] First question comes from the line of Eddie Leung of Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nEddie Leung -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you and good evening. My question to you has to do with your relationship with merchants. We know that online, there are an increasing number of different channels available to merchants, including your traditional competitors and also new and emerging competitors and with the popularity of many programs on the rise. At the same time, we note the increasing scrutiny of antimonopoly practices by the regulatory authorities in China.\n\nSo I'm wondering if in that context, you're seeing any changes in terms of merchant retention rates. And also from an operational perspective, is there anything you can do to improve given that merchants now have more available different channels?\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you. This is Daniel, and I will take that question. Indeed, it's true that today, there is an increasing diversity in terms of the variety of Internet user products available, and all of them can be utilized as an opportunity to engage in e-commerce. If you have the users, and you're able to hold on to those users and you couple that user base with online payment capabilities and third-party delivery capabilities then anybody essentially can engage in e-commerce.\n\nIt's a way of taking advantage of that user traffic. At present, the reality for most merchants, if not all, is that there are multiple different platforms out there that they can choose to work with, and that is the reality. Although we do have very few exclusive flagship store arrangements with a small number of merchants even with respect to those merchants, the fact is that their goods are also available through other channels through their own channels with distributors or other channels, and that is a fact that's for everybody to see. Our advantage is that we are extremely focused on consumption, and we are the No.\n\n1 platform when it comes to consumer mind share for consumption, and we're providing a very high-quality consumer experience. So that is why for all merchants, although they do have a choice of multiple platforms and are present on multiple platforms, we are probably, for most of them, the most important platform. Looking at merchants, be it in terms of retention rates, in terms of activity or their focus on the platform, we see no decline. And to the contrary, we tend to see increases, and that is because e-commerce is becoming a more and more important retail format for merchants, in general.\n\nAlibaba provides a wide range of services, including sophisticated management tools for merchants to manage their online business, as well as their online and offline combined businesses that contribute to enhanced overall efficiency for merchant operations. So this is fundamentally different from a one-off campaign-driven approach that you would see, for example, with live streaming or short-form videos that drives a single campaign. We are focused, in contrast to that, on providing that whole suite of tools and services to drive overall merchant performance, helping them increase their sales and maintain healthy profitability. And that is the reason why we are the premium platform that merchants choose to work with.\n\nEddie Leung -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nThank you. Many thanks to Daniel and our translator.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Gregory Zhao of Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory Zhao -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you. Just a very quick question as to whether you could give us any guidance on capital expenditure trends in the next few years. We know that there are a number of important new technologies where you're making progress coming out of DAMO Academy with the cloud. We can expect perhaps to see expenditures in infrastructure, cloud infrastructure, R&D, as well as in computing power.\n\nIf you could just please give us some guidance on where you see capital expenditure heading in the next few years.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you for your question. Well, on the issue of capex, if you look back to the presentation, I just delivered, you'll see that we gave the figure there for the December quarter. For the quarter as a whole, it was RMB 5.8 billion. And included within that figure was RMB 4.9 billion for operating capex, so that covers IT.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nSo in absolute terms, that is a relatively small figure. And indeed, as a proportion of our revenues, it would still be a single-digit percentage, in the mid-single digits. Comparing that against our international peers, it's not very high. Going forward, our plans for the future will be to strengthen, increase our investment in technology, in R&D and in the DAMO Academy.\n\nAnd so, we hope to see, going forward, capex increasing, both as an absolute value, as well as a percentage of revenue.\n\nGregory Zhao -- Barclays -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign language], Maggie.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Next question is from the line of Alex Yao of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Yao -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nGood evening and thank you management for taking my question. My question has to do with Daniel's opening statement in which he talked about the evolving policy environment and Alibaba's commitment to take on more social responsibility. So specifically, my question is taking on more social responsibility, how will that translate in operational terms into changes on the operations side and if you could perhaps help us think through a bit how those kinds of operational changes may have an impact on the company's financials? Thank you.\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you for your question, and I do think that is a very good question. As a platform economy, Alibaba has always taken very seriously its social responsibility and has made this very much part of the mainstream of our efforts to develop as a platform. And in years past, we've indeed done a lot of work on this front. Going forward, as a platform economy ever more deeper integrated with the overall economic and social development of the country, we do plan to take on yet more social responsibility.\n\nSomething very important for Alibaba, in particular, is mainstreaming that responsibility and making it part and parcel of everything we do, be it helping to create jobs, to stimulate employment, helping SMEs on every front from product distribution all the way through manufacturing. On the manufacturing side, we can play a role and also helping them to export their products. There are many things that Alibaba can do. And I think the key point here is the social responsibility for Alibaba is not something separate from our operations, and our business rather is at the mainstream of everything we're doing around operations and business as a platform.\n\nSo taking on more social responsibility in the sense is conducive to driving prosperity of the platform. And more prosperity on the platform, again, enables us to take on more social responsibility, the two are mutually reinforcing. So we don't look at it in terms of the economic value that can be generated by social initiatives, rather we see this in terms of holistic ecosystem value. That's how we've always approached it, and we will continue to approach it in that same way.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Alicia Yap of Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thank you. Good evening, management. Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nCongrats on the solid results. My question is related to the reinvestment in strengthening your overall marketplace business. So I understand this will be for some time, and you will continue to deleverage the marketplace EBITDA. But then is there any way management could help us rank in terms of the investment stages and also the resource that we will put into accordingly, for example, Taobao Deals, Taobao Live, the Short Videos and also the Taobao Grocery.\n\nHow do we evaluate some of this reinvestment has achieved the certain results and then that you will scale back? So any colors in terms of ranking the importance and also the stages of some of these seed investment currently? Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThanks. Let me answer this question. First of all, I think as we always said, we always invest for the future. And for our investment in the seed business, in new business, in core commerce, actually, we think these are new businesses, but we view these new opportunities from the entire, I mean, ecosystem point of view.\n\nSo we think to enhance our leadership position in core commerce, we need a different, I mean, applications, different services to meet different -- to meet the customers demand from different perspective. So like today, as you know that we -- our Taobao Deals enjoy very rapid growth, and this quarter, we reported our MAU for Taobao Deals surpassed 100 million. We are very happy to see the initial results. But we strongly believe that the investment in Taobao Deals is very important measures for us to target the customers in low-tier cities even in the rural areas and leverage our supply power from like other business in Alibaba, like 1688, so on and so forth.\n\nWe have very effective supply, and value for money supply to meet the demand of the customers with low purchasing power. And in terms of our investment in Taobao Live, it has been for a while. And today, if you look at the Taobao Live business, it's very -- it's already very sizable. And every day, we have tens of thousands of live streaming on our platform, which not only initiated by the KOL, but also done by many storefront owners.\n\nSo I think we are -- we highly integrate the live streaming together with our retail platforms. And live stream become a very effective marketing tool for our storefront and also create new business opportunities for KOL. So in this regard, we will continue to invest in the live streaming. But we don't -- once again, we don't view live streaming as a separate business.\n\nInstead, actually, live streaming is a very important new retail format in the commerce platform. So I will stop here for translation first.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nWell, in terms of Taobao groceries, as I said in my script, we are developing a very unique model based on the customer value proposition as opposed to subsidization to ensure the good user experience and the business sustainability. I think the very important thing is that we try to build our own model as opposed to what you see in the market, just burn money for -- certify the customers for scale. I don't think this is a sustainable model. Instead, we have such a tremendous user base already in Taobao.\n\nAnd so, that's why we position -- in Taobao mobile app, we have our Taobao Grocery as a major customer interface for this new business. And so, far, we -- based on our initial test, we saw very good results. And this Taobao Grocery business not only help us to have more supplies to the local customers, especially in the low-tier cities, but also help us to recruit many new customers while assistance of these, I mean, community leaders. So we will continue to invest in this business, but we will try to leverage all the resources we have in Alibaba and in some new retail business, in our investing companies and in our multiple supply channels.\n\nSo from a financial perspective, I think we don't manage our core commerce business by EBITDA. We think the growth of the user base and growth of the consumption in multiple categories across countries is a key. So our strategy is very clear, and we are very confident to invest more in this area. Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. Just to add one more point on Taobao Grocery. Today, we're still in the pilot test for Taobao Grocery in some of the cities. And so, today, only a small portion of Taobao users can access the service.\n\nBut over time, we will roll this service out across the country and the collaboration with multiple suppliers across Alibaba business. Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign Language]\n\nAlicia Yap -- Citigroup -- Analyst\n\nThank you, Daniel.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Thomas Chong of Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nHi. Thanks, managment, for taking my questions, and congratulations on the positive EBITDA for the cloud business. May I ask about how we should think about the competitive landscape on the cloud business in the coming years, as well as our strategy in the IaaS, PaaS and the SaaS side? And how should we think about the margin trend as well? Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. Yes, our cloud community is a very promising business. We do believe that in the future, all the industrial sectors, they need cloud services. Today, the market also has in the market, we also see a very fierce competition.\n\nBut obviously, Alibaba has a very big advantage in term -- in many areas. First is that by leveraging our huge scale, e-commerce, financial services and logistics, we are able to build a very scalable cloud infrastructure, which support our own business first today, and we roll out this infra to serve third-party clients. So in this case, in terms of internal scalability, we are in a very superior position.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe second advantage we have is the data intelligence capabilities and applications we have to serve our clients. Actually, in China, today, when you talk with many clients who want to use cloud, actually, their purpose is not about only moving to the cloud. Instead, what they want is by moving to the cloud, they are able to better usage -- to better use of their data. So the data intelligence capability and applications are the key.\n\nIn this regard, we are obviously in a -- once again, in a very superior position. We have a lot of expertise -- experiences in internal data usage and data intelligence.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nYeah. And the third advantage we have is about the technology. For years, we invested in the cutting-edge technology for cloud very aggressively via our DAMO Academy, via our recruitment of the first-class engineers and the scientists. So today, we are -- in terms of some of the key product features in cloud such as database, such as storage, such as the middleware services, so on and so forth, we are -- our product and services, our quality of the product and services are better than our competitors.\n\nSo I think we get very good feedback from our customers. So I think the technology is still the key.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nIn summary, we invest a lot in technologies in the area of IaaS and PaaS. In terms of SaaS, we work very actively with our partners in different industries, try to create a SaaS ecosystem, cloud-based SaaS ecosystem. So this is our general strategies for cloud, and we are very confident about the future of this business. Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nThomas Chong -- Jefferies -- Analyst\n\nThank you.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nNext question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Jerry Liu of UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJerry Liu -- UBS -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you. My question has to do with the investments that you've talked about that you intend to be making in the next period to come, including around Taobao Deals, live streaming and so on and so forth. And the impact that, that will be expected to have on EBITA or EBITDA growth because if you look at EBITA or EBITDA growth over the past few years, the pace of growth has really remained quite stable. Going forward, would we expect to see that growth rate moderate as a result of those investments? Or would that possibly be offset by improvements in the profitability of other new businesses like cloud, Ele.me or Trendyol? Thank you.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThanks very much. And indeed, it's very interesting that whenever we talk about Alibaba's financial performance and future outlook, we always get questions about our profitability and our margins and whether we expect to be able to sustain them at the same levels that they have been at. And we're very grateful for that. And it's very much a function of the fact that we have created high expectations by always being able to create profit and maintain healthy margin levels.\n\nAnd we know that others in the same market are getting different kinds of questions, and the expectations are different. Now, of course, we are in the same market with all the other companies, and it is a valid question as to whether we would prioritize and put in first place profit growth going forward or whether, instead, we would prioritize investing in our future growth and in new businesses? And Alibaba's answer to that is very clear. It's not a question that we even need to think about. We are always investing in future growth.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nIf you look at where Alibaba is today in terms of profitability, looking at the last 12 months or actually the figure I can give you is from the last nine months, the past three quarters, adjusted EBITA was 147.8 billion. That's very strong. But that figure already includes various reinvestments of profit that we have made. So I think we're in a good place and have the ability to continue to invest.\n\nYou can also look at our profit increment, say, over the last two-year period, if you compare the first nine months of this year to the first nine months of the year before last, you're talking about a fairly substantial figure of 30 billion. So this is our development strategy. We continue to invest in the future. And as we see that strategy paying off and as the new businesses grow, we will expect to continue to scale up our investments.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nSo looking at the potential, the huge potential that exists in the market, today's situation of competition and our own progress and where we're at, as I said in my prepared remarks earlier, our approach will be to continue to invest, to scale up our investment. We will never prioritize margin that will never be No. 1 for us, and it never has been in the past. And when it comes to profit growth, I think we have a very strong foundation in place, in particular with Taobao, Tmall and the China retail marketplace.\n\nWe're building on a very strong foundation of profitability.\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nLet's take the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Youssef Squali of Truist Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nYoussef Squali -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking the question. Just a very quick one. I was wondering if you could -- if you guys can discuss the impact of the reimposition of restrictive measures due to COVID-19.\n\nSo far, what you've seen in January, and just a sustainability of the recovery short term for in the -- as we go into the fourth quarter. Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you. For the impact of the COVID, here in China, in some cities, government take new approaches to lockdown some of the areas in the cities and encourage people to stay at the home cities instead of going back to the hometown for their Chinese New Year. So we are closely monitored the progress of these new measures. And so, far, I think we haven't seen a very material change of the consumption of the business.\n\nBut, obviously, -- because for January, it's very -- if you look at apple to apple to last year because last year, Chinese New Year is in late January, while this year is in the middle of February. So we have some time gap between two Chinese New Years.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nAs a result of some lockdowns in some of the cities, from the logistic perspective, we see some challenge because of this lockdown. But I think because for the last mile delivery force, because of the staying at the city policy, I was -- we expect this -- I mean, last -- the capacity will be enough for the last mile while the transportation might be a challenge because of some lockdowns. Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nNext question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Lee -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you talk about maybe investment in some of the new innovations that you see in a marketplace like smart transportation and autonomous driving? It seems like government is making a concerted effort in terms of building up smart transportation nationally. And talk about maybe how you're participating in that build down and how are you positioned to win that market.\n\nThanks.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nFor the smart transportation and autonomous driving, I think we do it from different angles. For smart transportation -- for our AliCloud business, actually, we closely worked with some partners in create the smart transportation solutions based on the cloud infrastructure. And I think this vertical solution will be widely used in many areas to create this, I mean, smart transportation capabilities. Well, for autonomous driving, actually, our DAMO -- in our DAMO Academy, we have a dedicated team working on this for years.\n\nAnd so, far, what we focus is about to apply this autonomous driving into the logistics area. And we've already deployed many -- I mean, autonomous cars are in school campuses, in some residential areas to the last-mile delivery and from the service station to the buyers at home or student's dormitories. And so, I think this will have -- today, I think this is still under early stage. But I would say autonomous driving will have the wider range of the applications.\n\nSo we will closely monitor the progress, and once again, we will invest for the technologies to make sure we are in the leading position in this area. Thank you.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nOperator, last question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question is from the line of Binnie Wong of HSBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\nHi. [Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you, management. My question is about the new businesses you're investing in. I'm wondering if you could tell us which of those you see as having the largest addressable markets and the greatest amount of synergy because we know that in new retail and in cloud, Alibaba was the first company to get into those spaces. You've been very successful.\n\nAnd now you're the largest in those spaces. So looking at the new businesses, how do you see the synergy, the addressable market? Are there any cross-selling metrics that you could share with us to exemplify that kind of synergy that exists? And then the other question perhaps for Maggie is around the new initiatives. You told us earlier that losses are narrowing. If you could give us a little more color on which ones are narrowing and the expectations there?\n\nDaniel Zhang -- Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nThank you. This is Daniel, and I'll take the first part of that question. Indeed, we're constantly working to incubate new businesses, including in core commerce. We've talked quite a bit about that today, but also in other areas.\n\nAnd our approach in terms of the incubation process is always to be patient and to make it a long-term commitment. So some of these, we're already starting to see become -- well, to gain traction and become quite successful already, including Taobao Deals and including Taobao live streaming. And in all of these cases, these are businesses that have been through a period of incubation and investment, and it's taken patients to get to where they are. Any business that we incubate, we're constantly looking for ways to create new differentiated value, a good user experience and to drive efficiency, and we're indeed investing in some even earlier stage offerings as well, both in core commerce and in other segments seeking, in all instances, to differentiate a solution or a service to satisfy customer demand.\n\nMaggie Wu -- Chief Financial Officer\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nOK. Thank you, everyone, for -- sorry about that.\n\nUnknown speaker\n\nPart of your question was about which of the businesses are seeing losses narrow the most? And my answer to your question in a nutshell would simply be that all of the businesses that have been loss-making, we're seeing losses narrowing across the board. So with respect to Ele.me, digital, media and entertainment, New retail, Lazada, even the smaller businesses like cross-border and, of course, the larger businesses like cloud and Cainiao where losses have been relatively large in the past, as you see now, they're solidly on track toward healthy profitability. So, I guess, the biggest change looking at where things are now would be with local services. So certainly, Ele.me and also Cainiao.\n\nAnd this is also a question that we ask ourselves on a daily basis and have had a lot of internal discussion around, i.e., in our loss-making businesses, should our primary goal be trying to further narrow the losses or should it be trying to further drive business growth? And you know our answer to that has been that we're reinvesting selectively and following a lot of study and discussion, reinvesting to grow the business. Now, the next quarter will be the final one of the financial year and an appropriate time for us to look forward to and offer overall guidance for the next year. And so, we expect to be doing that with you the next time we see you.\n\nBinnie Wong -- HSBC -- Analyst\n\n[Foreign language]\n\nRob Lin -- Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Binnie. Sorry for the interruption before. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today.

            "Headline": "Alibaba Earnings: What Happened",
            "Text": "Key Takeaways Adjusted earnings per ADS was 22.03 yuan vs. the 21.07 yuan analysts expected.\n\nRevenue beat analyst expectations.\n\nAnnual active consumers in China was higher than the level estimated by analysts.\n\nAlibaba Cloud achieved positive adjusted EBITA for the first time.\n\nWhat Happened\n\nAlibaba reported Q3 FY 2021 earnings per ADS that surpassed analyst expectations. Revenue was also above analyst forecasts and exhibited an acceleration in YOY growth compared to recent quarters. Annual active consumers in China were higher than expected. Alibaba also noted that its cloud business achieved positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization (EBITA) for the first time.\n\n(Below is Investopedia's original earnings preview, published February 1, 2021.)\n\nWhat to Look For\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Ltd. (BABA), the Chinese e-commerce giant that's successfully expanding amid the COVID-19 pandemic, has found itself in the crosshairs of China's market watchdog. The Chinese State Administration for Market Regulation has launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba, mirroring the antirust investigations U.S. regulators have launched against big American tech firms Facebook Inc. (FB) and Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL).﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nInvestors will be watching to see how Alibaba is dealing with the China antitrust probe, and also whether the company can maintain its robust growth when it reports earnings on February 2, 2021 for Q3 FY 2021.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Alibaba's fiscal year (FY) ends in March. Analysts expect adjusted earnings per American Depositary Share (ADS) and revenue to post healthy gains compared to the year-ago quarter.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nInvestors also will focus on Alibaba's annual active consumers in China, also called \"active buyers.\" This key metric is used to gauge the number of users making purchases on its platform. Analysts expect annual active consumers in China to grow, but at a slower rate than in recent years.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nShares of Alibaba have outperformed the broader market over the past year. But that performance has been volatile. After reaching a recent peak in late October in anticipation of a public listing of Alibaba's financial-technology affiliate, Ant Group Co. Ltd., the stock tumbled when the IPO was blocked by Chinese regulators. It received another big setback in late December after regulators launched an antitrust investigation.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ The shares have recovered some of their losses and have provided a total return of 24.0% over the past 12 months, above the S&P 500's total return of 15.6%.\n\nSource: TradingView.\n\nAlibaba's stock initially jumped after reporting earnings for Q2 FY 2021. Adjusted earnings per ADS climbed 37.2%, its fastest rise since Q3 FY 2020. Revenue rose 30.3%, a robust pace but slightly below what analysts were expecting.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ The company highlighted the strong performance of its core commerce and cloud computing businesses.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ However, the stock quickly resumed its downward trend.\n\nIn Q1 FY 2021, Alibaba posted an 18.1% rise in adjusted earnings per ADS as revenue rose 33.8%. While the company's revenue is still growing at a fast pace, it has decelerated from growth rates between 56-61% between late FY 2017 and early FY 2019.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ The stock continued its upward trend over subsequent months until its peak at the end of October.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting that both earnings and revenue will rise in Q3 FY 2021. Adjusted earnings per ADS is expected to grow 15.8%, the slowest pace since Q4 FY 2020. Revenue is expected to rise 33.1%. For full-year FY 2021, analysts expect adjusted earnings per ADS to rise 27.9% while revenue climbs 37.3%. It would mark a deceleration in annual earnings growth from the previous year, but a slight acceleration in annual revenue growth.﻿﻿﻿﻿"

            "Text": "Alibaba said the business prospects and IPO plans for its Ant Group subsidiary are \"subject to substantial uncertainties\" thanks to \"significant changes in the Fintech regulatory environment in China.\"\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Co. Ltd. (BABA) - Get Report posted stronger-than-expected third quarter earnings Tuesday thanks to a record Single's Day shopping even in November, but cautioned that the delayed IPO of Ant Group is still subject to \"substantial uncertainties\".\n\nAlibaba said diluted non-GAAP diluted earnings for the three months ending in December, the group's fiscal third quarter, were pegged at $4.42 per share, well ahead of the Refinitiv-collected forecast of $3.23 pre share. Group revenues, Alibaba said, rose 37% to 221.08 billion Chinese yuan, or $34.25 billion. That also topped analysts' forecasts of a $33.04 billion tally.\n\n“China was the only major economy to achieve positive GDP growth last year. Thanks to the rapid recovery of China’s economy, Alibaba had another very healthy quarter,” said CEO Daniel Zhang. “We achieved another successful 11.11 Global Shopping Festival by stimulating consumption, satisfying consumer demands and supporting the business recovery of merchants in response to the impact of the pandemic.\"\n\n\"Our cloud computing business continues to expand market leadership and show strong growth, reflecting the massive potential of China’s nascent cloud computing market as well as our years of investment in technology,\" he added. \"Looking ahead, we are confident that we will continue to create value for our customers, lead with innovation and make our contributions to society.”\n\nAlibaba's U.S.-listed shares were marked 1% lower in pre-market trading following the earnings release to change hands at $262.25 each.\n\nAlibaba's Singles Day shopping event in November topped $75 billion in gross merchandise value, a staggering total that dwarfs the record $10.4 billion spent during Amazon Inc.'s (AMZN) - Get Report two-day Prime Day event last month.\n\nIn late December, however, Chinese regulators set their sights on Asia's most valuable tech company in their latest attack on the financial empire of billionaire Jack Ma.\n\nChina's State Administration for Market Regulation launched its probe into Alibaba, and demanded a meeting with officials from its affiliate Ant Group Co., amid a broader push to tackle anticompetitive practices in internet commerce, including the alleged pressuring of merchants to list their goods on a single online platform.\n\nThe investigation follows last month's dramatic suspension of the planned $37 billion IPO of Ant Group and the summoning of billionaire Ma by government officials, as well as the People's Bank of China, to \"provide views regarding the health and stability of the financial sector\"."

            "Text": "In this article we will share our list of the 15 best innovative stocks to buy now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Innovative Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nWe are on the cusp of huge transformational changes that will fundamentally change the way we work, the way we live and take care of our health, the way we shop and spend our free time, and the way we eat. These changes are exponential in nature. This means every single year we make bigger progress than the year before. You may not see many changes from this year to the next, but in about 5 to 10 years our lives will change dramatically.\n\nThe number one change that’s happening is in the genomic space. A year ago we heard about an obscure coronavirus that was rampant in a Chinese region, but we didn’t pay much attention to it. It was spreading exponentially. Exponential growth sneaks up on us. We don’t notice any changes to our lives from one day to the other. Things start to change very very slowly, and then speed up. Within a couple of months of its “known” emergence in China, the coronavirus started spreading in our communities. At the beginning of March of 2020, we had our first few cases. By the middle of March, we had a few dozen COVID-19 deaths. By the middle of April we had more than 33000 deaths.\n\nA decade ago, it would have been unthinkable to produce a vaccine to fight a coronavirus in less than a year. Pfizer and Moderna were testing their vaccine candidates in less than 6 months; their vaccines received emergency authorization in less than a year thanks to the progress we have achieved in the genomic space. This is just the beginning.\n\nThere are multiple companies within the United States as well as all around the world that are working on cutting edge gene editing technologies to develop treatments for cancer, chronic diseases, and antibiotic resistant infections. Gene editing technologies will also speed up innovation in the agriculture space.\n\nBest Innovative Stocks To Buy Now\n\nMSCI’s Global Transformational Changes Index tracks the performance of “a set of companies that are expected to derive significant revenue from one or more of four themes: Future of Work, Digital Consumer, Genomics & Telehealth and Food Revolution.” This Index of innovative stocks returned 38.7% in 2020 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 20 percentage points. Broad market index funds give investors only a small exposure to technologically innovative stocks. That’s why MSCI’s Global Transformational Changes Index was able to beat the market by a very large margin last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW) tracks the performance of MSCI’s Index by investing in the same companies using the same weights utilized by MSCI’s index. As of January 27th ANEW had more than 150 stocks among its holdings and its two biggest holdings were Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALNY) and Apple Inc (AAPL). Both of these stocks had a weight of 2.15% in the ETF. The top 50 holdings of ANEW accounted for 74% of the ETF.\n\nIn this article we will rank the top 50 holdings of ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW) using Insider Monkey’s hedge fund sentiment data and identify the 15 best innovative stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Since our hedge fund sentiment data excludes the foreign stocks, our list will be excluding some potentially very innovative and transformational foreign companies. For example ANEW’s third and fourth biggest holdings are Chinese tech giant Tencent and Meituan with portfolio weights of 2.14% and 2.07%. These two stocks won’t be included in our list because of lack of hedge fund sentiment data.\n\nYou have to keep in mind that our rankings represent hedge funds’ list of 15 best innovative stocks to buy. Our premium newsletters might have a different opinion on these stocks. You already know that ProShares have a different opinion than the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey.\n\nLet’s now take a look at the best innovative stocks to buy now.\n\n15. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\n\nNumber of HFs: 82\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $7.7 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 30\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.33%\n\nNVIDIA’s chips powered nearly every major AI breakthrough (see our article). Artificial Intelligence will be a more significant technology than the internet. NVDA is a stock that investors should buy and hold forever. One hedge fund manager doesn’t agree with this assessment. Here is what Vulcan Value Partners said in its 2020 Q3 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”\n\n14. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI)\n\nNumber of HFs: 93\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $4.2 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 7\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.98%\n\nActivision Blizzard Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) is a video game holding company founded in 2008 as a result of a merger between Activision Inc. and Vivendi Games. It owns some of the very famous gaming titles such as Call of Duty, Candy Crush Saga, Diablo, and Warcraft. It develops games for all key platforms including mobile, game consoles, and PCs. Moreover, it also conducts eSports leagues and tournaments to generate revenue, besides making money from ads and in-game content.\n\nThe Santa Monica, California-based game publisher has enjoyed tremendous growth over the past year as the global video game industry thrived during 2020 due to the Covid-19 outbreak. Stuck-at-home gamers spent more time playing video games during the pandemic that drove revenue for gaming stocks including ATVI. The company’s revenue in the previous quarter climbed 38 percent on a year-over-year basis to $1.28 billion. Moreover, it also raised its revenue outlook for the full year from $7.25 billion to $7.67 billion.\n\nCEO Bobby Kotick said in an interview last year that the company plans to hire at least 2,000 people to meet production demands. Meanwhile, Activision plans to launch more games for mobile devices to capitalize on the massive mobile user base. Its chief operating officer Daniel Alegre said in a statement that ATVI will gradually bring all its games to mobile.\n\nActivision’s games performed exceptionally well in 2020. The company announced last month that its “Call of Duty” franchise hit a record $3 billion in total bookings over the past 12 months. Looking forward, it plans to launch the highly anticipated “Overwatch 2” and “Diablo 4” for PC and “Diablo Immortal” for mobile.\n\nNumber of HFs: 104\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $13.9 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 6\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.98%\n\nNetflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), founded in 1997, is a video streaming giant based in Scotts Valley, California. With the aggressive international expansion in recent years, it has become the world’s biggest subscription streaming service. The company went public in May 2002 by selling 5.5 million shares at $15. It has come a long way since then, overcoming many challenges in its decades-long journey.\n\nRuane, Cunniff & Goldfarb talked about Netflix, Inc. in its 2020 Q4 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth. Netflix is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Netflix because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”\n\n12. Adobe Inc. (ADBE)\n\nNumber of HFs: 106\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $10.5 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 19\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.82%\n\nADBE ranks 12th in our list of the best innovative stocks to buy. California-based Adobe has become a household name because of its multimedia and design products, such as Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects. In fiscal fourth quarter, Adobe’s revenue jumped 14% on a year-over-year basis to reach $3.42 billion. Creative segment revenue came in at $2.08 billion, while Document Cloud sales totaled $411 million. For fiscal 2021, the company expects $15.15 billion in revenue, compared to the Wall Street estimate of $12.8 billion.\n\nAdobe is also one of the top 3 stock picks of Qualivian's Aamer Khan. Here is what he told Insider Monkey about ADBE:\n\nA document, media and commerce software company which is at the forefront of the digital revolution. Its products are, by a long way, leaders in their respective segments, and are steadily increasing share. The company’s successful migration from a software license sale to a subscription model in the 2012-2014 time frame has resulted in a visible, recurring and highly profitable revenue model.\n\nNumber of HFs: 106\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $11.1 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 45\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 0.85%\n\nSalesforce.com, Inc.(NYSE: CRM) is a cloud-based software company that brings customers and companies together. Through their One Integrated Customer Relationship Management Platform, they are able to provide customer relationship management solutions that give all the departments whether it be sales, marketing, commerce or service, a single distributed view of every customer. Here is what Alger Spectra Fund said about CRM recently:\n\n“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”\n\n10. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)\n\nNumber of HFs: 124\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $7.6 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 32\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.27%\n\nWedgewood Partners summarized its BMY investment thesis in its latest investor letter:\n\n“Bristol-Myers Squibb recently reported accelerating sales as much of the medical services industry returned to work. The Company continues to expect double-digit earnings growth over the next few years, driven by existing drugs, in addition to a broad pipeline of new drugs and indications. While the market remains fixated on a couple of patent expirations that could occur over the next several years, we think this is well-known at this point, yet the market still undervalues a couple of key acquisitions the Company has made in the past few years, particularly Celgene, which was acquired for a song.”\n\n9. Mastercard (MA)\n\nNumber of HFs: 133\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $15.6 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 36\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.17%\n\nDel Principe O’Brien Financial Advisors' comments on Mastercard explains how a large number of fund managers see Mastercard. Here is what they said:\n\n“The market pullback in the spring gave us a chance to become owners of Mastercard, one of the biggest players in the global payments industry. In fiscal year 2019, the company processed almost $5 trillion in purchase transactions and holds 29% of the global market share for credit cards and 24% of the global market for debit cards. In June, Mastercard entered into an agreement to acquire Finicity, a financial data and insight provider, for a purchase price of $825 million. The move is meant to strengthen Mastercard’s existing open banking platform. Open banking is a system that gives third parties, including other banks and tech start-ups that provide financial services (think budgeting apps), digital access to financial data. A user-focused innovation in the banking industry, open banking is thought to be the future of banking. We see an active investment in its open banking platform as a good move for Mastercard toward maintaining its leadership in the global market.”\n\n8. Apple Inc. (AAPL)\n\nNumber of HFs: 134\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $127 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 2\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 2.15%\n\nApple ranks 8th in our list of the best innovative stocks to buy now. In its 2020 Q3 investor letter RiverPark summarized why Apple is a great long-term investment:\n\nWe believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in what are still the early innings of the mobile technology revolution. Additionally, a fall 5G launch should benefit the company, COVID has highlighted the opportunity for the Apple Watch to be an essential health monitoring device, and the company has rapidly diversified into new high growth and high margin products. AirPods, which were launched only three years ago, are on track to generate $15-$20 billion in revenue this year, 5%-8% of total company revenue. iPhones continue to represent a progressively smaller portion of total revenue (44% of the company’s third quarter revenue, down from 48% a year ago), which should help to lessen the impact of year-to-year iPhone refresh cycles. At the same time, Services provides robust growth for the company ($13 billion, up 15% yearover-year, and 22% of revenue in the June quarter, and more than $39 billion so far in Apple’s fiscal 2020, is accretive to the company’s margins (Services gross profit grew 20% for the quarter and accounts for 39% of total company gross profit) and adds a large, recurring revenue segment to the company’s business mix. The company maintains a fortress balance sheet with $193 billion of cash, $80 billion net of debt. We expect excess cash flow of more than $60 billion per year, which has been increasingly returned to shareholders through both a growing dividend and increased share repurchases. The company also recently completed a 4 for 1 stock split that was well received by investors.”\n\n7. PayPal Inc. (PYPL)\n\nNumber of HFs: 150\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $11.5 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 37\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.07%\n\nPYPL ranks 7th in our list of the best innovative stocks to buy now. PayPal revolutionized digital payments and it is not done yet.\n\n“The really important thing is to take a step back and see that there is a tremendous rise in all forms of digital payment right now”. The CEO of PayPal (PYPL), Dan Schulman said, 40%-70% of consumers want to use a ‘cashless’ method in all their transactions not only in malls, restaurants but also in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. PayPal is known for operating an online payment system that supports money transfers in majority of countries around the world. There are 26 million Paypal merchants up to date.\n\n“Not only would we allow people to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies but very importantly, they could use those as a funding source… to buy any of our 28 million merchants,”. According to Schulman, PayPal is beginning to add more functionality to cryptocurrencies. “The promise is to use a modern technology to enhance the utility of payments,” said Schulman in an interview with CNBC.\n\n“What we’re most excited about is enabling people to take that cryptocurrency and effectively turn it into a currency to be able to use it in any of our 28 million merchants,” said Dan Schulman while also stating that they’ll do these things without any volatility. “We’ll take that crypto, and convert it to fiat currency so they can immediately accept it”.\n\n6. Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)\n\nNumber of HFs: 106\n\nValue of HF Holdings: $10.5 billion\n\nRank in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 25\n\nWeight in ProShares MSCI Transformational Changes ETF (ANEW): 1.68%\n\nAlphabet is really a portfolio of tech companies. Its main business is search, but it is also in streaming business. It is among the biggest cloud companies in the world. We featured Alphabet in our article about the 12 best autonomous vehicle stocks to buy. It is investing in quantum computing. It is one of the top artificial intelligence stocks to buy. Despite all of these investments, it is still wildly profitable. Here is what Wedgewood Partners said about Alphabet's core search business in its 2020 Q4 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet’s core Google revenues grew +9% during the quarter, a meaningful acceleration from the -8% decline during the COVID-19-impacted second quarter. The Google unit also unexpectedly showed some modest expense leverage after several quarters of heavy reinvestment, driving double-digit earnings growth at Alphabet. We would not be surprised if that leverage is short-lived. However, Alphabet continues to meaningfully under-earn relative to its potential, and we welcome any effort that brings forward, or at least highlights, the Company’s pent-up earnings power. On the latter score, Alphabet announced it will be providing more detailed operating segment profit data in the coming year.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Innovative Stocks To Buy.

            "Headline": "Alibaba Analysts React To Earnings Beat: 'Strong Momentum Despite Increased Competition'",
            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability.

            "Headline": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited -- Moody's assigns A1 to Alibaba's proposed senior notes; outlook stable",
            "Text": "Rating Action: Moody's assigns A1 to Alibaba's proposed senior notes; outlook stableGlobal Credit Research - 03 Feb 2021Hong Kong, February 03, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned an A1 senior unsecured rating to the proposed USD notes to be issued by Alibaba Group Holding Limited. (A1 stable).The rating outlook is stable.Alibaba will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and for eligible projects in connection with its sustainability notes.RATINGS RATIONALE\"Alibaba's A1 issuer rating reflects its integrated and diversified e-commerce platforms, which provide sustainable cost advantages that allow the company to generate solid profit margins and maintain strong credit quality with a solid net cash position,\" says Lina Choi, a Moody's Senior Vice President.\"The rating also takes into account Alibaba's well-established brand name and dominance in China's (A1 stable) fast-growing e-commerce market; its track record of monetization through fees from online marketing, services and subscriptions; and transaction-based commissions,\" adds Choi.The rating incorporates risks related to Alibaba's aspiration to continue expanding its business scope within and outside China. As the company expands its businesses, Moody's expects its currently high profit margins to be diluted because of the consolidation of strategic business initiatives such as Ele.me, Lazada and Cainiao Network. However, these new initiatives should also help the company grow its scale and expand its service offerings, and in turn strengthen its cash flow.The rating also considers increased regulatory risk, as evidenced by a recent antitrust investigation by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). While the investigation is credit negative and could limit Alibaba's revenue and earnings growth, the company has a track record of working with regulators to make operational changes without materially hurting its solid business profile.In view of its ongoing investment requirement and heightened regulatory risks, Moody's expects Alibaba to maintain a strong balance sheet with net cash position over the next one to two years, along with a prudent approach to investments and acquisitions. These factors will provide it with a buffer against further regulatory uncertainties.The rating also takes into account potential contingent liabilities associated with Ant Group Co., Ltd, in which Alibaba holds a 33% stake.Alibaba's proposed senior unsecured notes will improve its debt maturity profile and expand its capacity to accommodate any funding needs over the next one to two years.The proposed notes will have limited impact on Alibaba's debt leverage, as earnings growth in the coming one to two years should offset the increase in debt.Moody's expects Alibaba's revenue to grow around 20% per annum in the next one to two years from the RMB644.2 billion reported for the 12 months ended December 2020. This compares with 35% revenue growth for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2020. Moody's also expects the company to maintain steady EBITDA margins of 20%-25%.As such, Moody's expects Alibaba's adjusted debt/EBITDA will stay around 1.0x-1.2x in the next one to two years, which is appropriate for its A1 ratings.Alibaba's liquidity is excellent. As of 31 December 2020, it held RMB456 billion in cash and cash-like resources. Together with estimated annual operating cash flow of RMB180 billion-RMB210 billion, Alibaba's internal cash flow is more than sufficient to cover its reported short-term debt of RMB15.0 billion, capital spending and investment needs.Moody's has also considered the following environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations.In terms of social factors, Alibaba is exposed to heightened scrutiny by regulators with respect to perceived anticompetitive behavior, in turn raising legal, regulatory and reputational risks. These risks could impede Alibaba's business growth.Alibaba also faces moderate data privacy and security risks, as it generates and processes a large volume of personal, transaction, demographic and behavioral data. The company manages such risks, inter alia, by complying with legal and regulatory requirements for the collection, processing, retention and protection of its data. However, it could face operating and financial damage in the event of a cyber breach.Governance considerations include the concentration of director selection voting power in Alibaba Partnership, which is comprised primarily of the company's directors and executive officers. In addition, Alibaba operates under a variable interest entities (VIE) structure, and the main VIEs (onshore operating companies) that generate cash flow are controlled by two limited partnerships comprised of members of Alibaba Partnership or senior management.However, these governance risks are mitigated by the balanced board composition, featuring a majority of independent nonexecutive directors. In addition, the company's shareholder base is highly diversified and includes more than 200 shareholders across the world.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe stable outlook on Alibaba's issuer and senior unsecured ratings reflects Moody's expectation that Alibaba will maintain its dominant position in China's e-commerce market, continue to generate steady cash flow from its domestic retail and wholesale marketplaces to support its strong balance sheet with a solid net cash position, and not engage in larger-than-expected debt-funded acquisitions such that its financial profile will remain appropriate with its A1 ratings in the next 1 -2 years.An upgrade is unlikely, because Alibaba's rating is already at the same level as China's sovereign rating, a country where it conducts most of its operations and activities.Moody's could downgrade the ratings if Alibaba (1) fails to fend off competition and experiences substantial declines in market shares or substantial disruptions in its integrated ecosystem that hurt revenue growth and cash flow; (2) deviates from its stated financial policy and aggressively grows loans at Ant Group beyond Moody's current expectations, thereby increasing the risk of additional financial requirements from Alibaba; and (3) engages in aggressive acquisitions that strain its balance sheet liquidity or increase its overall risk profile.Financial indicators for a downgrade include adjusted debt/EBITDA trending toward 2.0x or a net debt position, both on a sustained basis. Moody's will also monitor for any sustained deterioration in the company's adjusted retained cash flow/debt, which has been maintained around 70%-85% since 2015.Furthermore, adverse developments in the regulatory framework that adversely affect Alibaba's operations and cash flow generating capabilities, or result in a significant capital call from Ant Group, would strain the rating.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Business and Consumer Service Industry published in October 2016 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1037985. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Founded in 1999 by Jack Ma and a group of partners, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba) is a global leader in retail commerce, which enables merchants, brands, retailers and other businesses to engage and transact with their users and customers.Predominantly focused on China, Alibaba operates various retail and wholesale marketplaces within its core commerce segment. The company also engages in cloud computing services, digital media and entertainment and innovation initiatives. Online escrow payment services are provided through Ant Group.Alibaba owns a 63% stake in Cainiao Network, an operator of a logistics data platform and a global fulfilment network leveraging on capacities of local partners.Alibaba completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on 19 September 2014. The company completed its secondary public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 26 November 2019.REGULATORY DISCLOSURESFor further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity to Assumptions in the disclosure form.

The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Headline": "Alibaba Offers Few Answers as Crackdown Uncertainty Persists",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. offered investors few clues into how the regulatory crackdown on Jack Ma’s tech empire will impact its future growth after reporting a stronger-than-expected 37% increase in quarterly sales.\n\nThe e-commerce giant has established a special taskforce to conduct internal reviews and is actively communicating with antitrust regulators on complying with their requirements as investigations continue, Alibaba said Tuesday. It’s also unable to make a complete assessment of how the ongoing “rectification” of affiliate Ant Group Co. will affect its business, according to the statement.\n\nThe stronger-than-expected earnings may be overshadowed by an ongoing antitrust probe that has already wiped more than $130 billion off the e-commerce giant’s value since its October record. Uncertainty began in November when regulators first torpedoed Ant Group’s record initial public offering, then launched their investigation into the online retailer. Alibaba’s stock has dropped 13% since Ant’s aborted debut, the worst performance on Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index. The shares in New York fell 3.9%.\n\n“Ant Group’s business prospects and IPO plans are subject to substantial uncertainties,” Alibaba Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said on a conference call Tuesday. “We will further update the market when the investigation is concluded.”\n\nSeparately, Alibaba said it will kick off what could be a $5 billion dollar bond sale this week, picking up a plan that went quiet when its founder had been out of sight.\n\nRead more: Jack Ma Emerges for First Time Since Ant, Alibaba Crackdown\n\nAlibaba’s shares recouped some of their losses after Ma resurfaced in public during a live-streamed video conference last month, in an apparent signal that worst-case scenarios -- such as a government-led takeover or break-up of his companies –- are probably now off the table. Few expect Beijing to entirely back off its campaign to more tightly regulate Ant, Alibaba and the rest of China’s high-tech giants. But the stock’s partial recovery suggests investors are beginning to price out the risk of a crackdown that would put the country’s richest entrepreneurs and most innovative companies in serious jeopardy.\n\nStory continues\n\nZhang spent a substantial portion of Alibaba’s earnings call talking about the company’s “social responsibility” in elevating small merchants and driving rural consumption, two of Xi Jinping’s priorities as Beijing tries to lift the countryside from poverty.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nThe full impact of the anti-monopoly investigation into Alibaba by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR), as well as the new fintech regulations on Ant Group, may remain uncertain for some time. Alibaba disclosed with its 3Q results that it’s fully cooperating with SAMR but the investigation is yet to conclude. The company is also unable to provide a complete and fair assesssment of what effect changes to Ant Group will have on its business.\n\n-- Vey-sern Ling and Tiffany Tam, analysts\n\nClick here to read the research\n\nSales climbed to 221.1 billion ($34.2 billion) during the December quarter, topping the 215.3 billion yuan average of analyst forecasts, while net income climbed 52%.\n\nTwo of Alibaba’s largest and fastest-growing divisions made it into the black during the holiday quarter -- an important milestone for the company. Its cloud business reported its first ever positive adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization, while revenue for the segment rose 50%, driven by customers in the internet, retail and public sectors. Cainiao, its logistics unit, was also operating cash flow positive, the company said.\n\nAnnual active consumers grew to 779 million in the December quarter, driving a 38% increase in its core commerce business. Alibaba booked $75 billion of sales over its annual Singles’ Day promotions last November, easily beating its 2019 haul after the company began promotions early and added additional services to the count for the first time. The increased spending came even as overall retail sales fell 3.9% last year, with consumption lagging industrial activity in the broader economic recovery.\n\nBut investors are questioning whether Alibaba can sustain that growth as Beijing steps up oversight of Chinese tech giants, particularly in online commerce. Ma’s firm, once the standard-bearer for China’s fast-rising private firms and booming internet sphere, now faces penalties of as much as 10% of its revenue or some $7.8 billion if it’s found to have violated rules against practices like forced exclusive arrangements with merchants known as “Pick One of Two,” predatory pricing or algorithms favoring new users.\n\nAny regulations requiring Alibaba to implement a full halt to forced-exclusivity policies may hit Tmall’s sales by close to a tenth in 2021, before sales return to 18-20% annual growth in 2022 and beyond, according to San Francisco-based Octahedron Capital Management LP. As of now, less than 10% of the top-selling brands are exclusive, they estimated. While Alibaba has exclusive flagship stores with some merchants, in most cases they can sell the same goods on other platforms, Zhang said.\n\nThe regulations may also hamper its ability to fend off rivals from JD.com Inc. to Pinduoduo Inc., whose 730 million annual consumers are closing in on Alibaba’s user base. Meanwhile, short-video platforms like ByteDance Ltd. and Tencent-backed Kuaishou Technology are also tapping livestreaming as a sales outlet to wrest a larger e-commerce share. Beijing-based ByteDance revealed its Singles’ Day takings for the first time in 2020, with Douyin, the Chinese version of global sensation TikTok, booking 18.7 billion yuan in gross merchandise value.\n\nAnt contributed 4.8 billion yuan to Alibaba’s profit in the quarter, indicating that the company earned 14.5 billion yuan in the three months ended September -- before its $35 billion IPO was scuttled -- as its earnings lag one quarter behind Alibaba. As part of the crackdown, Ant has been told to “rectify” its lending, insurance and wealth management services.\n\nRead more: Jack Ma’s Ant Posted $2.3 Billion Profit Before Halt of IPO\n\nStricter capital requirements may kneecap Ant’s ability to issue loans as freely, adding to challenges for its sister company’s commerce operations. The fintech giant provides small unsecured credit to about 500 million people through its Huabei (Just Spend) and Jiebei (Just Lend) platforms. These are used in part to pay for purchases of clothing and makeup from the Taobao marketplace or trips booked on Fliggy, the group’s online travel site.\n\nPayments using Huabei on Alibaba’s China marketplaces represent only a very small percentage of total credit granted under the platform, Zhang told analysts Tuesday. The “vast majority” of its customers have linked their payment accounts to multiple funding sources, he added.\n\nTighter regulatory scrutiny over mergers may impede the tech giant from snapping up promising startups in emerging industries or taking outsized stakes in other businesses to ward off competition. Alibaba -- which had in recent years spent billions on stakes in hypermart operator Sun Art Retail Group Ltd. and NetEase Inc.’s Kaola e-commerce platform -- was fined 500,000 yuan in December for not seeking approval before boosting its holdings in department store chain Intime Retail Group Co. in 2017.\n\n“The business performance is strong and many feel the shares are undervalued compared to the roadmap and trajectory of some of their businesses,” Andy Halliwell, an analyst at technology consultancy Publicis Sapient, said in a research note after the earnings result. “However, if the Chinese government is looking to crack down on outspoken entrepreneurs and take a more conservative line with their larger tech businesses, then this will dent investors’ confidence in the brand and may create an opening for others to exploit.”\n\nClick here for a live blog on the numbers.\n\n(Updates with bond issuance in fifth paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Date": "2021-02-03",
            "Headline": "Amazon's new CEO is a 'cloud titan' — here's why that matters",
            "Text": "Wednesday, February 3, 2021\n\nThis article was first featured in Yahoo Finance Tech, a weekly newsletter highlighting our original content on the industry. Get it sent directly to your inbox every Wednesday by 4 p.m. ET. Subscribe\n\nAmazon (AMZN) is getting a new CEO, and he’s the same executive who turned the e-commerce giant into a cloud computing juggernaut. Andy Jassy, the head of Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS), will replace Jeff Bezos as CEO in the third quarter.\n\nThe change means Amazon will likely pour even more resources into its all-important, $45 billion-a-year cloud business. While Amazon is estimated to control 45% of the cloud market, competitors like Microsoft and Google are clawing away at its lead.\n\nIt’s no coincidence the person behind AWS will now lead Amazon. “This is a doubling down on AWS and the cloud services strategy,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance. “Jassy is a cloud titan. He's really helped build the cloud industry to where it is today.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean Amazon will take its foot off the gas in terms of its e-commerce platform. On the contrary, if Jassy follows the same playbook as Bezos, Amazon will only grow bigger after recording one of its best quarters ever on Tuesday.\n\nDoubling down on the cloud\n\nFounded in 2006, AWS is one of Amazon’s greatest successes. To be sure, in terms of overall revenue, e-commerce dwarfs AWS, with 2019 full year retail revenue coming in at $340 billion compared to AWS’s $45.47 billion. But that hardly tells the whole story.\n\nDespite earning less revenue, AWS crushes Amazon’s e-commerce efforts in terms of margins. In 2019, retail operating income was $9.37 billion, while AWS’s was an incredible $13.5 billion.\n\nBut despite being a cloud innovator, Amazon faces fierce competition. Microsoft (MSFT) is nipping at AWS’s heels with its own cloud platforms including Azure, while Google (GOOG, GOOGL) continues to build out its own formidable cloud services.\n\nIn this Dec. 5, 2019, file photo, AWS CEO Andy Jassy, discusses a new initiative with the NFL during AWS re:Invent 2019 in Las Vegas. (Isaac Brekken/AP Images for NFL, File)\n\nMicrosoft, according to Gartner, now controls 18% of the cloud market, while Google has 5%. And a slew of other competitors are in the running including IBM (IBM), Alibaba (BABA), and Oracle (ORCL), all hoping to snag their own piece of the growing cloud industry.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Microsoft is narrowing that gap, as we're seeing even play out this quarter,” Ives said. “So Jassy getting anointed as CEO makes a ton of sense given the cloud strategy.”\n\nWith Jassy as CEO, Amazon will have a leader who’s aware of the threat posed by its cloud rivals, and who has a proven track record of innovation in the lucrative cloud industry.\n\nJassy and Bezos are ‘cut from the same cloth’\n\nBezos founded Amazon in 1994 out of his parents’ Seattle garage as an online book retailer. And just three years later, Jassy joined Amazon after receiving his MBA from Harvard.\n\nJassy has spent 23 years at Amazon, which included expansions into music, movies, original content, grocery, and, of course, AWS. It’s clear he and Bezos have a similar vision.\n\n“He was an early employee and with that comes kind of an indoctrination of the culture,” Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance. “I would find it hard to imagine that they're not cut from similar cloth. It's a very facts and detail, analytical type of background. And that's what I’ve seen with Andy Jassy.”\n\nJeff Bezos will step down as CEO sometime in the company's third quarter. (Credit: Dennis Van Tine/MediaPunch /IPX)\n\nFollowing the announcement, analysts predicted that Jassy will carry on the same practices as Bezos, down to providing a summary of every executive meeting’s purpose.\n\n“We don’t think a lot is going to change, with Jassy likely to carry on Bezos’ same core values & beliefs given similar operating cultures between consumer [and] AWS,” J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote.\n\nAmazon isn’t done expanding\n\nUnder Bezos, Amazon grew from an online book retailer to a grocer, movie and TV studio, pharmaceutical retailer, and cloud juggernaut. And that’s unlikely to stop under Jassy.\n\nBezos has always prioritized the customer, going so far as to forgo turning a profit for Amazon’s first seven years. During a 2018 speech before the Economic Club of Washington, Bezos said Amazon’s success came from its “obsessive compulsive focus on the customer, as opposed to obsession over the competitor.” And Jassy, a long-time Bezos lieutenant, will likely carry on that mission.\n\n“Mr. Bezos has built [Amazon] along the lines of the flywheel effect that is often discussed, and we expect Andy Jassy as CEO to mean a continuation of [Amazon’s] key themes of delighting the consumer and executing as scale builds and compounds in all of its businesses,” UBS Global Research’s Eric Sheridan wrote.\n\nAnd Amazon has plenty of room to grow. While it’s the undisputed king of e-commerce, its overall retail market share is still in the single digits. Then there are its other businesses, including Prime Video, which lags behind Netflix’s 203 million subscribers.

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Headline": "Why Alibaba Stock Was Climbing Today",
            "Text": "What happened\n\nShares of Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) were moving higher today, a day after the Chinese tech giant delivered a strong quarterly earnings report. Today, the company benefited from a chorus of positive analyst notes as well as news of detente between the Chinese government and Ant Group, Alibaba's former financial arm in which it owns a one-third stake.\n\nThe stock closed up 3.5% after gaining as much as 5.4% earlier in the session.\n\nSo what\n\nRevenue jumped 37% to $33.9 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2020, ahead of estimates at $33.4 billion. Adjusted EBITDA rose 22% to $10.4 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 21% to $3.38, also topping expectations for $3.25.\n\nAlibaba shares pulled back yesterday, but today five analysts lifted their price targets on the stock, maintaining buy ratings and showing overall approval for the third-quarter results.\n\nInvestors also seemed to cheer the news that Ant Group had reached an agreement with Chinese regulators to turn Ant Group from a fintech company into a financial holding company. That could pave the wave for Ant Group's IPO, which was blocked by Chinese regulators in November. Ant was expected to fetch a valuation of $280 billion, leading to a payday for Alibaba that would make its stake worth nearly $100 billion. That valuation could be affected by any changes to the company to comply with regulations, including adding more stringent capital requirements, but the news is clearly a step forward for Ant Group. Alibaba's Hong Kong shares jumped when the announcement came out.\n\nNow what\n\nManagement didn't provide guidance in the earnings report, saying it would give guidance for the upcoming fiscal year in its next report. However, there's little reason to doubt the company's momentum. Active customers rose by 22 million in the quarter to 779 million and it saw strong growth in cloud, with revenue up 50%, and logistics, where its Cainiao Network delivered 51% revenue growth, showing the company diversifying beyond e-commerce.\n\nAlibaba has faced controversy in recent months around the Ant IPO, an antitrust investigation, and reports that founder Jack Ma had been \"missing,\" but the Ant news shows an apparent thaw in its relationship with Chinese authorities. Considering its growth rate and its price-to-earnings ratio at just 27, the stock looks like one of the best bargains on the market right now."

            "Date": "2021-02-03",
            "Headline": "Why I'll Never Own Alibaba Stock",
            "Text": "I once considered Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) an undervalued growth stock. It still trades at just 21 times forward earnings, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 50% and 37%, respectively, this year. And its market-leading positions in China's e-commerce and cloud markets also grant it the scale to easily crush its smaller rivals.\n\nBut after carefully reviewing Alibaba again, I believe I'll never buy this seemingly attractive Chinese tech stock, for three simple reasons.\n\n1. Its growing dependence on lower-margin businesses\n\nAlibaba resembles an inverted version of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Whereas Amazon subsidizes the growth of its lower-margin retail segment with its higher-margin cloud business, Alibaba subsidizes the growth of its unprofitable businesses (including its cloud division) with its higher-margin \"core commerce\" revenue.\n\nTherefore, Alibaba's future earnings growth relies heavily on its core commerce segment, which includes its online marketplaces, cross-border marketplaces, brick-and-mortar stores, and Cainiao logistics unit.\n\nAlibaba's core commerce business is still growing at a healthy clip. Its core commerce revenue rose 35% in fiscal 2020, which ended last March, and accounted for 86% of its top line. The segment's revenue rose another 32% year over year in the first half of fiscal 2021.\n\nHowever, it's also relying more heavily on its \"New Retail\" business (including its brick-and-mortar stores), its cross-border wholesale segment, and Cainiao to drive its growth. These businesses all generate lower-margin revenue than its core Taobao and Tmall marketplaces, which charge merchants listing fees and commissions.\n\nThat's why the adjusted EBITA margin of its core commerce segment declined from 38% to 35% between the second quarters of 2020 and 2021. Its total adjusted EBITA margin held steady at 27%, thanks to narrower losses at its unprofitable businesses, but that balancing act could easily fall apart in the near future.\n\n2. Endless regulatory challenges\n\nMeanwhile, a seemingly endless barrage of regulatory challenges in the U.S. and China could make it even tougher for Alibaba to keep growing.\n\nLast December, the U.S. passed a law that would delist any foreign companies that didn't comply with new auditing requirements for three straight years. Alibaba's secondary listing in Hong Kong in late 2019 indicates its days on the NYSE could be numbered.\n\nTaobao also remains on the U.S. Trade Representative's \"Notorious Markets for Counterfeiting and Piracy\" blacklist due to the prevalence of counterfeit products across its platform. That reputation could spark sanctions against its cross-border marketplaces.\n\nIn China, government regulators clearly want to rein in Alibaba. In 2019, the government sent officials to work at dozens of companies, including Alibaba, to oversee their operations. Last year, the Communist Party's Central Committee tightened that grip by requiring all companies to hire a certain number of registered members of the CCP.\n\nThat tension finally boiled over last year when China brought its hammer down on Alibaba. It derailed the long-awaited IPO of its fintech affiliate Ant Group, fined Alibaba over an unapproved acquisition, and launched a full antitrust probe into its e-commerce operations.\n\nThe regulators reportedly want Alibaba to end its exclusive deals with merchants and throttle its promotional pricing strategies, which could make it tougher for its core profit engine to keep running. It would also leave Alibaba more exposed to competition from JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) -- which both previously accused Alibaba of anticompetitive strategies.\n\n3. Ethical considerations\n\nBack in 2017, the Chinese government declared that the country would rely on Alibaba for the development of smart cities, Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) for digital healthcare, and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) for driverless cars.\n\nThe term \"smart cities\" might seem vague, but it's collectively referring to Alibaba's cloud services and facial recognition technologies. The Chinese government relies heavily on those technologies to monitor its citizens, and those technologies are tightly tethered to a government database.\n\nThat's already troubling, but Alibaba recently demonstrated how its technologies could be used to identify the faces of Uighurs and other ethnic minorities across China. Alibaba claims the feature can be embedded into websites to monitor users for terrorism, pornography, and other \"red flags.\"\n\nChina's human rights record is already dismal, and it's currently accused of imprisoning and sterilizing Uighurs in reeducation camps, so Alibaba's disturbing claims spark far too many ethical concerns. They could also make Alibaba an easy target for sanctions if the Biden administration maintains the Trump administration's tougher stance against Chinese tech companies. As a result, I'm avoiding Alibaba for the same ethical reasons I recently sold Tencent: I'm simply not interested in owning a piece of China's mass surveillance system.\n\nThe key takeaway\n\nI understand why Alibaba still looks like an appealing stock buy for many investors, and it could certainly climb higher in the future. However, there are simply too many regulatory, growth-related, and ethical challenges ahead for me to consider it a worthy long-term investment."

            "Text": "Stocks wobbled early Wednesday, opening mixed as the market struggled to extend its two-day rebound. The Nasdaq Composite moved firmly higher, boosted by earnings from Alphabet. Marijuana stocks rallied. China stocks were also active, as Alibaba bounced back from a slip on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Amgen dragged on the Dow Jones today.\n\nX\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite plowed 0.6% higher, closing in again on its Jan. 25 and once again placing strain on the margin above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%. The Dow industrials trimmed its opening gains to a fraction on the stock market today, as Amgen dragged 2.3% lower after its fourth-quarter report.\n\nIn Washington, Senate Democrats advanced President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package along a straight party-line vote Tuesday night. The House is scheduled to vote on its own version of the package on Wednesday. A statement from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer naming marijuana reform as a priority sent pot stocks soaring in early trade.\n\nBut earnings were the overriding influence on early action. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) dominated the top of the Nasdaq 100 with a 5.7% gain. IBD Leaderboard stock PayPal Holdings (PYPL) rose 1.1% ahead of its earnings report, due out after the close.\n\nCheck Point Software (CHKP) dived 9% to the bottom of the Nasdaq 100. Electronic Arts (EA) also sat near the bottom of the index, down more than 5% after reporting a strong fiscal third quarter, but soft fourth-quarter guidance. Barclays and Piper Sandler raised price targets on the stock. Raymond James initiated coverage with an outperform rating. Electronic Arts ended Tuesday in a buy range above a cup-with-handle buy point at 148.46.\n\nGear up for Wednesday's market action by reading IBD's Investing Action Plan.\n\nAmazon Near Buy Point, Bezos Takes New Role\n\nAmazon reported a 118% earnings gain and a 44% revenue advance, blowing past Wall Street targets. Founder Jeff Bezos announced he would handoff his Chief Executive role to cloud services chief Andy Jassy, adopting the new title of executive chairman.\n\nAmazon stock reversed its early gain and dropped 0.6% Wednesday, as more than a half-dozen analysts boosted the stock's price target to above 4,000.

However, headphone maker Koss (KOSS) bolted 44% higher.\n\nSilver prices, also reportedly a target of the trading group, gained 2.6% to above $27 an ounce. That was down about 10% from Monday's high, and up not quite 10% from its Dec. 1 closing price. The iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV) rose 2% in early trade.\n\nM & A: Jazz Pharmaceuticals, 10X Capital Venture\n\nGW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) spiked 48% while Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) edged 0.2% higher, after Jazz agreed to buy GW Pharma in a $7.2 billion cash-and-stock deal. Jazz agreed to pay $220 per share for the U.K.-based developer of cannabinoids, compounds found in cannabis.\n\nAnother segment of the cannabis industry was also rallying early Wednesday, after a joint statement from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and two other senators named \"ending the federal marijuana prohibition\" as a priority, and prepared to introduce legislation within weeks.\n\nTilray (TLRY) shares jumped 10%. Aphria (APHA) climbed 9.9%. Cronos Group (CRON) jumped 7.6% and Aurora Cannabis (ACB) gained about 4%. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) rallied 9.2%.\n\nBlank check operation 10X Capital Venture Acquisition (VCVC) spiked 42%, after announcing a merger agreement with car components innovator REE Automotive. The deal is expected to leave the merged company with $500 million in cash, and an enterprise value of $3.1 billion, the companies said.\n\nDow Jones Today: Caterpillar Hangs In A Buy Zone\n\nBoeing (BA) scrambled up 1.6%, to the top of the Dow Jones today. Apple (AAPL) added 0.2%. Caterpillar (CAT) dipped 1.1%.\n\nApple continues to weave over and under a 138.89 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. IBD Leaderboard points out that the stock has nearly doubled from its breakout in April, and that the current base is a third-stage pattern, \"which is a reason to have lower expectations this time around.\"\n\nCaterpillar stock is in a buy zone on a strong rebound from its 10-week moving average. IBD SwingTrader puts the stock's buy point at 189.57, with a buy zone that runs to 193.54.\n\nADP Reports Surprise Jump In Hiring\n\nBeginning the ramp-up to Friday's January payrolls report from the Labor Department, payroll manager ADP reported early Wednesday that U.S. private sector employers added 174,000 workers in January. That reversed December's 74,000-worker decline, and trounced expectations for 50,000 new jobs.\n\nMidsize employers did the bulk of the hiring, expanding payrolls by 84,000. Some 156,000 of the new jobs were produced by the services sector.\n\nOn Thursday, consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas rolls out its Challenger Job Cuts report for January, and the Labor Department reports unemployment claims numbers for the final week of January.\n\nStock Market ETF Strategy And How To Invest In The Current Uptrend\n\nAlso on Wednesday, researcher Markit reports its final January composite purchasing managers index at 9:45 a.m. ET. The Institute for Supply Management delivers its January services PMI at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nChina Stocks: Alibaba, Futu, Weibo, JD.com\n\nChina-based stocks racked up solid early gains Wednesday, after Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA) hammered out an agreement with Chinese regulators to restructure its giant Ant Financial fintech unit as a financial holding company, making it subject to the same regulator rules and scrutiny as banks. In the U.S., after announcing strong fourth-quarter results, Alibaba announced a $5 billion debt offering.\n\nAlibaba stock traded 4.6% higher early Wednesday. Shares are building the right side of a 15-week consolidation. Alibaba is an IBD Long-Term Leader.\n\nFutu Holdings (FUTU) continued its blazing advance, up more than 10% Wednesday as it rebounds from a quick pullback to test support. The stock is in the fifth week of an eight-week hold rule triggered after its Jan. 5 breakout.\n\nSocial media platform Weibo (WB) pared an early 5% jump to 0.3%, after ending in a buy zone on Tuesday. A week ago, the stock spiked above what MarketSmith chart analysis plots as a 46.89 buy point in a double-bottom base. Shares pulled back to test the buy point, ending Tuesday in a buy range that runs to 49.23.\n\nApparel flash sale giant JD.com (JD) pared an early rally to 0.2%. Macquarie lifted the stock's price target from 107 to 133, about 39% above Tuesday's closing price. JD.com stock is in a buy zone, above a 92.87 buy point in an eight-week cup base.\n\nDow Jones Today: Amgen Earnings\n\nAmgen (AMGN) was the only earnings news on the Dow Jones today, reporting late Tuesday that a 5% earnings jump easily topped analyst targets and a 7% revenue gain was in line with expectations. Shares fell 1.5%, however, as management's 2021 guidance pointed to a modest slip in earnings for the year.\n\nIBD Live: A New Tool For Daily Stock Market Analysis\n\nAmgen last week briefly cleared a 265.07 buy point in a 29-week cup base.

            "Text": "In this article we are going to list the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs.\n\nThe People’s Republic of China has evolved into one of the richest countries of the world in just a few decades. According to data published by the World Bank in 2019, the Gross Domestic Product or GDP of China has had a sharp increase since 1990, with the number climbing almost exponentially. David Mann, global chief economist at Standard Chartered Bank, commented on this rapid economic growth, stating that \"From the end of the 1970s onwards we've seen what is easily the most impressive economic miracle of any economy in history.\"\n\nThis success can be accredited to a number of reasons. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization, beginning the boom of Chinese goods in World trade. Research published by London School of Economics further illustrated this massive increase. By 1985, exports were $25 billion, $15 billion more than what they were 9 years ago in 1976. Just 25 years later, in 2010, exports valued at an amount of $3 trillion dollars; 300 times more than what the value was in 1985.\n\nAs trade between nations increased, so did the Chinese public’s interest in entrepreneurship. An entrepreneur is someone who participates in the act of setting up a business, while also bearing the effects of this risk in hope of a profit. A good business idea has the power to rake in millions but getting to that point where profit is being generated consistently can be a long, difficult journey.\n\n12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs\n\nMatej Kastelic/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Global Entrepreneurship Monitor is one platform which studies entrepreneurial behavior and attitudes of several countries across the world. Data collected in 2019 for China showed that 9.33 percent of the public (ages 18-64) owned an established business. This included those who are owning and managing a running business that has paid salaries, wages, or any other payments to the owners for more than 42 months. The same platform also displayed data on the attitude of Chinese society towards entrepreneurs. Almost 80 percent of people agreed with the statement that in their country, most people consider starting a business as a desirable career choice.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll this evidence points towards the fact that in general, entrepreneurs are viewed in a quite favorable light by the Chinese public. Because of this, those entrepreneurs who have a considerable reach may have the distinct power of influencing those around them. Whether this is by inspiring the population with their success story, or by introducing a revolutionary idea through their product, Chinese entrepreneurs have affected the general public in one way or another.\n\nFor this reason, we have prepared a list of the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs. To prepare their ranking, we have used Fortune China and Forbes as our source, ranking each business leader based on not only their company’s success, but also their influence on the general public. Let us look at the 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs, starting with number 12.\n\n12. Zhang Jindong\n\nDate of Birth: March 28, 1963 (age 57 years)\n\nOccupation: Co-founder and Chairman of Suning\n\nNet Worth: $62.1 billion (as of January 2nd, 2021)\n\nThe first person to grace our list of 12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs is 57-year-old Zhang Jindong. Zhang is the chairman of Suning.com, one of the largest retailers in China, and is said to be among the top 3 in the Chinese e-commerce industry. Zhang has certainly come a long way from when he first started the company in 1998 as an air-conditioning store. Throughout the years, he has diverged into many markets, moving from air conditioning to home appliances to online shopping. Zhang is also the owner of a privately-held company called Suning Holdings Group, which is particularly famous for having acquired the famous Italian football club Inter Milan. In 2019, Suning.com acquired 80% of Wanda Department Store and Carrefour China, increasing the reach of his company even further.\n\n10 Biggest Universities in the US\n\nRobert Kneschke/Shutterstock.com\n\n11. Wang Xing\n\nDate of Birth: February 18, 1979 (41 years)\n\nOccupation: Co-founder and CEO of Meituan\n\nNet Worth: $30.5 billion (as of January 2nd, 2021)\n\nWith a net worth of over 30 billion, Wang Xing has achieved great monetary success at a young age. In 2010, Wang founded the company Meituan, an application which connects consumers with businesses, offering different vouchers for a variety of retail services including entertainment, dining, delivery, and travel. The business model is similar to that of the American service Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN), while Meituan itself boasts an aspiration to be the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) of services. Having built Meituan to become a multi-billion dollar company, that dream doesn’t seem too far off. Meituan, formerly known as Meituan Dianping after the two companies’ merger, is not the only entrepreneurial stint of Wang. In 2005 and 2007 he created Chinese versions of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), called Xiaonei and Fanfou respectively. Although not at the level of Meituan, both websites proved to be hits for Wang, and showcased his drive for being a business leader.\n\nPixabay/Public domain\n\n10. Xu Jiayin (Hui Ka Yan)\n\nDate of Birth: October 9, 1958 (age 62 years),\n\nOccupation: Founder and Chairman of Evergrande Group\n\nNet Worth: $28 Billion (as of January 2nd, 2021)\n\nAccording to Forbes, Xu is the tenth richest man in China today. His company, Evergrande, is the second-largest property developer in the country by sales, generating a revenue of over 69 billion dollars in 2019. Although it is true that he has plenty of wealth in the present, Xu came from very humble beginnings. His mother passed away when he was only 8 months old, while his father was a retired soldier. He grew up in a rural family in a remote Chinese village, working for a cement product factory for a few years after high school. After graduating from university, he worked for several companies, climbing to the rank of director. At age 39, he decided to start his own company, named Evergrande, which currently ranks within the first 200 on the Fortune Global 500 and is a top competitor in the Real Estate Market. In recent years, Evergrande has invested over 43 billion dollars in new energy vehicles, and is said to be aiming to compete with Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) in the electric vehicle market.\n\nAndrey_Popov/Shutterstock.com\n\n9. Lei Jun\n\nDate of Birth: December 16, 1969 (age 51 years)\n\nOccupation: Founder, Chairman and CEO of Xiaomi Technology\n\nNet Worth: $27.7 Billion (as of January 2nd, 2021)\n\nKnown as China’s Steve Jobs, Lei is the founder of the leading smartphone manufacturer Xiaomi. In fact, Xiaomi has now surpassed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to be the 3rd largest smartphone maker in the world. In just nine years, Lei has led the company to become the youngest company on the Global Fortune 500 list last year, debuting at rank 468. He was also named Businessman of the Year by Forbes in 2014. Besides running an incredibly successful business, Lei has been active in relief efforts during the coronavirus pandemic in China. His company donated thousands of supplies to hospitals in Wuhan including 1,750 millet tablets, air purifiers, infrared thermometers, and walkie-talkies.\n\nGoogle logo, smartphone, app, device, mobile, tech, sales, android, phone, android, charging, laptop, computer\n\nd8nn / Shutterstock.com\n\n8.

However, Li’s dream is more than just making cars. In 2020, his company announced their decision to create a network of satellites to provide high-positioning precision services.\n\nShevel Artur/Shutterstock.com\n\n7.

            "Headline": "Alibaba Group Announces Pricing of Offering of US$5 Billion of Senior Unsecured Notes",
            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months.

Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

The PBOC, which is leading regulatory efforts on Ant's restructuring, did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.\n\nPBOC Governor Yi Gang, asked last week about a revival of Ant's IPO, replied, \"I'd say that you just follow the standard of legal instruction, you will have the result.\"\n\n'BIGGER AND STRONGER'\n\nThe regulatory crackdown on Ma's business empire in China, where he commands a cult-like reverence, followed an Oct. 24 speech in which he blasted the country's regulatory system.

The company follows a reporting schedule where the end of its fiscal year (FY) occurs at the end of March.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Alibaba also reports certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, amortization, and depreciation (EBITDA), and adjusted EBITA, which refers to earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Although Alibaba's reporting currency is the Renminbi, the company provides conversions into U.S. dollars, which are used in this story.﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nThe company's revenue rose 36.9% to $33.9 billion in Q3 FY 2021, which ended December 31, 2020.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ It was slightly above the 35.3% annual rate of growth posted for all of FY 2020, which ended March 31, 2020.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Alibaba's net income rose 55.5% to $12.0 billion in Q3 FY 2021 compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company noted that the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in the net gain from increases in the market prices of its equity investments in publicly-traded companies.﻿﻿\n\nAlibaba’s Business Segments\n\nAlibaba monetizes its services through four main business segments that it formally names as: core commerce, cloud computing, digital media and entertainment, and innovation initiatives and others. The company provides segment break downs of revenue and adjusted EBITA, the latter of which was reported as $9.4 billion for the company for Q3 FY 2021.﻿﻿\n\nCore Commerce\n\nAlibaba's core commerce segment is comprised of its various digital retail and wholesale marketplaces, as well as logistics and local consumer services. The company generates revenue from merchants through the sale of a variety of marketing services, membership fees, customer management services, product sales, commissions on transactions, and software service fees. The company generates revenue from local consumers through platform commissions and on-demand delivery service fees.﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nCore commerce is Alibaba's largest source of revenue at $30.0 billion, or about 88% of the company's total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment grew 38.2% compared to the same three-month period a year ago.﻿﻿\n\nIn terms of income measures, the core commerce segment represents nearly 100% of the company's adjusted EBITA, which grew 14.7% to $10.2 billion in Q3 FY 2021.﻿﻿﻿ Losses in two of Alibaba's other business segments partly account for the higher-reported figure in the core commerce segment than in adjusted EBITA for the company as a whole.\n\nCloud Computing\n\nAlibaba Cloud provides enterprise customers with a complete suite of cloud services, including database, storage, management and application services, big data analytics, a machine-learning platform, and other services.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ The company's cloud computing segment generates revenue from enterprise customers based on the duration and specific usage of the services.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nCloud computing is Alibaba's second largest source of revenue at $2.5 billion, or about 7% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. The segment is also the company's fastest-growing source of revenue. Revenue grew 50.3% compared to the year-ago quarter.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Alibaba reported adjusted EBITA of $3 million for its cloud computing segment in Q3 FY 2021, compared to a loss in adjusted EBITA in the year-ago quarter.﻿﻿ It was the first time the segment achieved positive adjusted EBITA.﻿﻿﻿ The cloud computing segment makes up just a tiny fraction of overall adjusted EBITA.﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nDigital Media and Entertainment\n\nAlibaba's digital media and entertainment segment exists as part of the company's strategy to capture revenue from consumption beyond its core commerce businesses.﻿﻿﻿﻿ The segment generates revenue primarily from customer management services and membership subscription fees.﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nDigital media and entertainment is Alibaba's third largest source of revenue at $1.2 billion, or about 4% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment grew 0.6% compared to the same quarter a year ago.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Alibaba reported a $213 million loss in adjusted EBITA in Q3 FY 2021.﻿﻿\n\nInnovation Initiatives and Others\n\nAlibaba's innovation initiatives and others segment aims to innovate and develop new services and products that can meet the needs of its customers. Past innovations include digital-navigation app Amap and network-communication app DingTalk.﻿﻿﻿﻿ The segment generates revenue primarily through services fees and product sales to enterprise customers and consumers.﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nInnovation initiatives and others comprise the smallest share of Alibaba's revenue at $207 million, or less than 1% of total revenue, as of Q3 FY 2021. Revenue for the segment rose 9.5% compared to the same three-month period a year ago.﻿﻿ Alibaba posted a $305 million loss in adjusted EBITA in Q3 FY 2021.﻿﻿\n\nAlibaba's Recent Developments\n\nAlibaba announced in late September 2019 its goal of reaching 1 billion annual active consumers in its China consumer business by the end of its 2024 FY, as part of its latest five-year plan.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ As of December 31, 2020, the company was still short of its goal by 221 million annual active consumers.﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\n﻿In late December 2020, China's market regulator, the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that it had launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba. The antitrust watchdog noted that it was acting in response to reports that Alibaba was pressuring merchants that sell wares on its platforms not to sell on the platforms of its competitors.﻿﻿﻿\n\nOn February 3, 2021, Chinese regulators came to an agreement on a restructuring plan that would turn Alibaba's financial technology affiliate Ant Group Co. into a financial holding company. That change would make the fintech firm subject to similar capital requirements faced by banks.﻿﻿﻿ The move comes after an attempted initial public offering (IPO) of Ant was halted by regulators in early November 2020, which was followed in late December 2020 by regulators issuing a statement that they would meet with Ant Group about implementing regulations and other rules.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿\n\nHow Alibaba Reports Diversity & Inclusiveness\n\nAs part of our effort to improve the awareness of the importance of diversity in companies, we offer investors a glimpse into the transparency of Alibaba and its commitment to diversity, inclusiveness, and social responsibility. We examined the data Alibaba releases to show you how it reports the diversity of its board and workforce to help readers make educated purchasing and investing decisions.\n\nBelow is a table of potential diversity measurements. It shows whether Alibaba discloses its data about the diversity of its board of directors, C-Suite, general management, and employees overall, as is marked with a ✔. It also shows whether Alibaba breaks down those reports to reveal the diversity of itself by race, gender, ability, veteran status, and LGBTQ+ identity."

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Headline": "Alibaba Group Holding Limited -- Moody's assigns A1 to Alibaba's proposed senior notes; outlook stable",
            "Text": "Rating Action: Moody's assigns A1 to Alibaba's proposed senior notes; outlook stableGlobal Credit Research - 03 Feb 2021Hong Kong, February 03, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned an A1 senior unsecured rating to the proposed USD notes to be issued by Alibaba Group Holding Limited. (A1 stable).The rating outlook is stable.Alibaba will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes and for eligible projects in connection with its sustainability notes.RATINGS RATIONALE\"Alibaba's A1 issuer rating reflects its integrated and diversified e-commerce platforms, which provide sustainable cost advantages that allow the company to generate solid profit margins and maintain strong credit quality with a solid net cash position,\" says Lina Choi, a Moody's Senior Vice President.\"The rating also takes into account Alibaba's well-established brand name and dominance in China's (A1 stable) fast-growing e-commerce market; its track record of monetization through fees from online marketing, services and subscriptions; and transaction-based commissions,\" adds Choi.The rating incorporates risks related to Alibaba's aspiration to continue expanding its business scope within and outside China. As the company expands its businesses, Moody's expects its currently high profit margins to be diluted because of the consolidation of strategic business initiatives such as Ele.me, Lazada and Cainiao Network. However, these new initiatives should also help the company grow its scale and expand its service offerings, and in turn strengthen its cash flow.The rating also considers increased regulatory risk, as evidenced by a recent antitrust investigation by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR). While the investigation is credit negative and could limit Alibaba's revenue and earnings growth, the company has a track record of working with regulators to make operational changes without materially hurting its solid business profile.In view of its ongoing investment requirement and heightened regulatory risks, Moody's expects Alibaba to maintain a strong balance sheet with net cash position over the next one to two years, along with a prudent approach to investments and acquisitions. These factors will provide it with a buffer against further regulatory uncertainties.The rating also takes into account potential contingent liabilities associated with Ant Group Co., Ltd, in which Alibaba holds a 33% stake.Alibaba's proposed senior unsecured notes will improve its debt maturity profile and expand its capacity to accommodate any funding needs over the next one to two years.The proposed notes will have limited impact on Alibaba's debt leverage, as earnings growth in the coming one to two years should offset the increase in debt.Moody's expects Alibaba's revenue to grow around 20% per annum in the next one to two years from the RMB644.2 billion reported for the 12 months ended December 2020. This compares with 35% revenue growth for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2020. Moody's also expects the company to maintain steady EBITDA margins of 20%-25%.As such, Moody's expects Alibaba's adjusted debt/EBITDA will stay around 1.0x-1.2x in the next one to two years, which is appropriate for its A1 ratings.Alibaba's liquidity is excellent. As of 31 December 2020, it held RMB456 billion in cash and cash-like resources. Together with estimated annual operating cash flow of RMB180 billion-RMB210 billion, Alibaba's internal cash flow is more than sufficient to cover its reported short-term debt of RMB15.0 billion, capital spending and investment needs.Moody's has also considered the following environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations.In terms of social factors, Alibaba is exposed to heightened scrutiny by regulators with respect to perceived anticompetitive behavior, in turn raising legal, regulatory and reputational risks. These risks could impede Alibaba's business growth.Alibaba also faces moderate data privacy and security risks, as it generates and processes a large volume of personal, transaction, demographic and behavioral data. The company manages such risks, inter alia, by complying with legal and regulatory requirements for the collection, processing, retention and protection of its data. However, it could face operating and financial damage in the event of a cyber breach.Governance considerations include the concentration of director selection voting power in Alibaba Partnership, which is comprised primarily of the company's directors and executive officers. In addition, Alibaba operates under a variable interest entities (VIE) structure, and the main VIEs (onshore operating companies) that generate cash flow are controlled by two limited partnerships comprised of members of Alibaba Partnership or senior management.However, these governance risks are mitigated by the balanced board composition, featuring a majority of independent nonexecutive directors. In addition, the company's shareholder base is highly diversified and includes more than 200 shareholders across the world.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGSThe stable outlook on Alibaba's issuer and senior unsecured ratings reflects Moody's expectation that Alibaba will maintain its dominant position in China's e-commerce market, continue to generate steady cash flow from its domestic retail and wholesale marketplaces to support its strong balance sheet with a solid net cash position, and not engage in larger-than-expected debt-funded acquisitions such that its financial profile will remain appropriate with its A1 ratings in the next 1 -2 years.An upgrade is unlikely, because Alibaba's rating is already at the same level as China's sovereign rating, a country where it conducts most of its operations and activities.Moody's could downgrade the ratings if Alibaba (1) fails to fend off competition and experiences substantial declines in market shares or substantial disruptions in its integrated ecosystem that hurt revenue growth and cash flow; (2) deviates from its stated financial policy and aggressively grows loans at Ant Group beyond Moody's current expectations, thereby increasing the risk of additional financial requirements from Alibaba; and (3) engages in aggressive acquisitions that strain its balance sheet liquidity or increase its overall risk profile.Financial indicators for a downgrade include adjusted debt/EBITDA trending toward 2.0x or a net debt position, both on a sustained basis. Moody's will also monitor for any sustained deterioration in the company's adjusted retained cash flow/debt, which has been maintained around 70%-85% since 2015.Furthermore, adverse developments in the regulatory framework that adversely affect Alibaba's operations and cash flow generating capabilities, or result in a significant capital call from Ant Group, would strain the rating.The principal methodology used in these ratings was Business and Consumer Service Industry published in October 2016 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1037985. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.Founded in 1999 by Jack Ma and a group of partners, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (Alibaba) is a global leader in retail commerce, which enables merchants, brands, retailers and other businesses to engage and transact with their users and customers.Predominantly focused on China, Alibaba operates various retail and wholesale marketplaces within its core commerce segment.

Online escrow payment services are provided through Ant Group.Alibaba owns a 63% stake in Cainiao Network, an operator of a logistics data platform and a global fulfilment network leveraging on capacities of local partners.Alibaba completed its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange on 19 September 2014.

            "Headline": "Alibaba's bond sale attracts US$38 billion worth of orders as investors shrug off antitrust fears and look to future of China's booming e-commerce industry",
            "Text": "Alibaba Group Holding's US$5 billion bond attracted an avalanche of orders from fixed-income investors, peaking at US$38 billion, on growing confidence that the e-commerce behemoth will emerge relatively unscathed from an antitrust investigation.\n\nThe scramble to buy the bonds allowed the platform company to sell its new dollar-denominated debt at a more advantageous price than initially expected, according to people familiar with the transaction.\n\nThe vote of confidence in Alibaba's long-term future comes after its founder Jack Ma was summoned by China's regulators for a dressing down in November and Beijing shelved an initial public offering by its financial affiliate Ant Group at the last minute. China's antitrust watchdog launched an antitrust probe into the firm's business practices on December 24.\n\nGet the latest insights and analysis from our Global Impact newsletter on the big stories originating in China.\n\nThe offering by the Hangzhou-based firm is its first foray into international debt markets since 2017 when it sold US$7 billion worth of bonds. The wait for Alibaba to come back to markets created pent up demand among investors, the people familiar said.\n\nAlibaba's founder Jack Ma. Photo: Reuters alt=Alibaba's founder Jack Ma. Photo: Reuters\n\nSovereign wealth funds, pension funds and global asset managers from the US and Europe were among the Who's Who list of investors who managed to squeeze into the deal. The global investment community looked to other technology giants' debt, such as bonds issued by Amazon, Google and Tencent, as proxies to calculate their bids.\n\nThe longest dated tranche of 40-year debt priced at 130 basis points over US Treasuries, coming in from guidance of 160 basis points, according to terms sheets seen by the Post.\n\nAlibaba is riding the wave of investors hunting for yield as central banks unleash liquidity into capital markets to spur an economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Over the past 12 months, companies have been able to issue longer-dated debt at historically low levels.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlibaba's 30-year notes carried a coupon of 3.15 per cent, and its 40-year bonds bear an interest of 3.25 per cent; lower than in 2017, when the company sold a 30-year bond with a coupon of 4.2 per cent and a 40-year bond with interest of 4.4 per cent.\n\nRatings agency Moody's labelled the notes as investment grade \"A1 Stable\" while S&P and Fitch both said they were \"A+ Stable\".\n\nThe bond sale comes after Alibaba reported a stronger-than expected 37 per cent surge in revenue for the quarter ended December, lifted by its extended Singles' Day campaign last year.\n\nChina's online shopping gross merchandise value will likely expand at a 12 per cent annually until next year and cloud-services by 35 per cent into 2023, according to consultancy iResearch. \"Alibaba will be a key beneficiary of the trend due to its market leadership,\" said Fitch ratings analyst Kelvin Ho.\n\nWhen Alibaba released results, it also said that the firm had established a task force to conduct an internal review as part of its efforts to cooperate with an antitrust investigation launched by China's State Administration of Market Regulation on December 24. The inquiry will look into the company's business practices, including its exclusivity agreements with merchants.\n\nMa delivered a video speech to 100 rural Chinese teachers in January, marking his first public appearance in nearly three months after his controversial speech at a Shanghai financial forum on October 24. Although Ma retired from his official positions at Alibaba in 2019, the 56-year-old is still widely regarded as a key figurehead for his business empire and the face of China's private business community.\n\nSentiment around the debt sale also received a boost from news on Wednesday that Alibaba's financial arm, Ant Group, and China's financial regulators, have agreed a plan to overhaul the planet's largest financial technology company.\n\nThe most liquid of Alibaba's existing bonds, its 3.4 per cent notes due 2027, were higher at 111.916 in Asian trading. Alibaba's outstanding debt has, in the most part, traded lower since December.\n\nAlibaba's New York-listed American depositary shares have also rallied, jumping 27 per cent from the low of US$211 plumbed on December 24.\n\nThe proceeds from the debt sale, excluding the sustainability notes, will be used for general corporate purposes, including working-capital needs, repayment of offshore debt and potential acquisitions of or investments in complementary businesses.\n\nThe active bookrunners on the deal are Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and China International Capital Corporation. Citigroup is the sustainability bond's structuring adviser.\n\nAlibaba plans to settle the transaction by February 9.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Text": "In this article we examine Maplelane Capital's top 10 stock holdings. You can skip our discussion of the hedge fund's performance and its investment philosophy in this article, and go directly to Maplelane's Top 5 Stock Holdings.\n\nThe $3.5 billion New York-based hedge fund Maplelane Capital fell 33% last month due to its short bets on several stocks including GameStop (NYSE: GME). Founded in 2010 and run by Leon Shaulov and Rob Crespi, Maplelane invests in stock markets on a global scale, with a strategy of generating profits in the short term utilizing options trading. The firm makes both put and call bets along with holding a long position in stocks. It has been focusing particularly on high growth stocks from information technology, consumer discretionary, and communications sectors.\n\nThe hefty losses in January are mostly due to its short bets that include GameStop, American Airlines Group Inc., iRobot Corp., and National Beverage Corp. The social media-fueled rally has targeted several highly-shorted stocks by calling everyone to buy and hold, driving share prices of these stocks significantly higher in a matter of few weeks.\n\nGameStop stock price rallied more than 1600% this year while new market movers have now shifted their focus towards several other sectors and assets. Reddit's WallStreetBets army and other social media day traders are now heavily buying silver and a few distressed crypto coins. The second-largest cryptocurrency Ripple rallied more than 250% in just a few days amid heavy buying from day traders.\n\nIn a tug of war, the hedge funds initially lost the battle against the powerful social media market movers, who used Reddit and YouTube to drive prices higher. Melvin Capital has lost more than 50% of its value in January while big names like Steven Cohen and Dan Sundheim’s hedge fund also fell at a double-digit rate.\n\nBut the tables are turning as regulatory authorities begin investigating the main Reddit account that launched the GameStop stock hype. GameStop shares crumbled earlier this week after a massive selloff. Reports also show that several hedge funds took huge profits by playing the GameStop rally smartly. According to a WSJ report, Senvest Management LLC made a whopping $700 million from their GameStop stake.\n\nStory continues\n\nHedge funds have closed their several short positions to protect them from further losses. For instance, Melvin Capital, which started the year with $12.5 billion in assets, recently reported that it has closed several short positions due to increased volatility.\n\nMaplelane Capital has also been working on a similar strategy. The firm is aggressively adjusting risk and altered its portfolio to avoid more losses.\n\nThe New York-based hedge fund held positions in 176 stocks according to the latest 13F filing. The hedge fund has initiated a position in 89 stocks and exited its stake from 39 stocks. Maplelane's investment philosophy is based on fundamental analysis and the firm seeks to benefit from market trends and price volatility. The average time held for the top ten stocks stands around 1.20 quarters.\n\nWhile Leon Shaulov and Rob Crespi's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 78 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

(NASDAQ: WDAY) outperformed the broader market trends in the last six months. Despite that, shares of Workday underperformed since the beginning of this year.\n\nIt ranks 10th on the list of Maplelane Capital's top 10 stock holdings. The hedge fund is bullish on Workday as the firm raised its stake in software provider by 124% in the September quarter after initiating a position during the second quarter.\n\nCooper Investors, which has generated a return of 9.96% during the December quarter, stated in an investor letter that Workday has strong fundamentals. Here is what Cooper Investors stated:\n\n“Workday (“WDAY”) is the Cloud leader in Human Capital Management (HCM) and Financials software. We first met WDAY 7 years ago as a much smaller enterprise but today it’s on the verge of reporting ~US$4bn in revenues. WDAY has had great success in its HCM offering particularly with the world’s largest companies. However its Financials product has seen more muted growth with customers reluctant to shift such a core function to the Cloud, success here tending to be in the mid-market. Financials comprise only 20% of company revenues today but with the pandemic forcing remote work and benefits, and reliability of Cloud applications becoming clear WDAY’s Financials solutions appear ripe for mainstream adoption.”\n\n9. Tencent Holdings Limited (OTCPK: TCEHY)\n\nMaplelane Capital has gained from its strategy of creating a big position in the Chinese internet advertising services provider Tencent Holdings Limited (TCEHY) during the September quarter. This is because shares of Tencent rallied more than 20% since the end of the September quarter.\n\nThe company’s aggressive growth strategy has been backing its share price momentum. Reports are hinting that Tencent is seeking to acquire gaming business Zynga. KeyBanc analyst Tyler Parker recently said that Tencent could increase its international growth with Zynga.\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD)\n\nMaplelane Capital is bullish over the future fundamentals of chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD). The hedge fund has raised its stake in AMD by almost 500% during the September quarter and it appears that the hedge fund has benefited from its investment strategy. This is because shares of AMD rallied 9% in the last three months despite its underperformance since the beginning of this year.\n\nCarillon Eagle Mid Cap Growth Fund has also presented a bullish case for AMD in an investor’s letter. Here is what Carillon stated:\n\n“Advanced Micro Devices produces semiconductor products and devices. The stock outperformed due to healthy growth in the personal computer and data center server markets. The company also continues to gain share against its major competitor, which is having significant issues in its next generation products. Furthermore, investors have appreciated the margins and profitability the company has been posting in addition to the topline strength.”\n\nThe hedge fund has capitalized on the massive share price rally of T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMUS) during the September quarter. Maplelane initiated a position in T-Mobile US during the second quarter and reduced its stake by 68% during the third quarter. Despite that, T-Mobile accounts for 1.99% of the overall portfolio. Its shares rallied 57% in the last twelve months.\n\nOakmark Funds has also initiated a position in T-Mobile US during the second quarter. Here is what Oakmark stated in an investors letter:\n\n“We initiated a position in T-Mobile after the company announced that regulators would approve its merger with Sprint. AT&T and Verizon have long dominated the market for wireless services due to their incumbent network quality advantage. The recently closed merger of T-Mobile and Sprint creates the first opportunity for a challenger to build the fastest, most reliable and highest capacity wireless network in the United States. We believe the impact of this combination will be non-linear from not only a network perspective but also a financial one. Our long-term investing horizon enables us to look several years ahead to assess the benefits of scale, synergy and low-incremental cost growth, which should generate more subscribers, faster revenue growth and higher margins. We like that the company will be led by veteran T-Mobile managers who have successfully integrated previous acquisitions and have gained impressive market share, despite a previously inferior network. A secondary offering by a large, non-economic seller gave us the opportunity to purchase our stake at a below market price.”\n\nThe New York-based hedge fund's strategy of creating a position in Pinterest, Inc. (NYSE: PINS) worked for them because shares of visual discovery engine rallied more than 200% in the last twelve months.\n\nArgosy Investors, which has generated 29.8% in select accounts for 2020, stated in an investor letter that they have capitalized the price gains. Here is what Argosy Investors stated:\n\n“With that in mind, we trimmed Pinterest (PINS) multiple times during the fourth quarter as the price increased over 200% from our initial purchase price in November 2019. This was a starter position for us at the time, and this is one of those stocks that investors kept buying because of Pinterest’s perceived benefit from stay-at-home orders. We agree that the lockdowns likely forced people globally to try things they wouldn’t have normally. As the CEO of Post Holdings (POST), Rob Vitale, said on a recent conference call about customers trying cereal while stuck at home, “that level of trial would have been extremely expensive and challenging to obtain”. Similarly, we believe people tried and liked Pinterest at a rate that would be extremely expensive for them to acquire through advertising.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Maplelane's Top 5 Stock Holdings Suggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: No position.

            "Headline": "Checking Out Alibaba's Latest Quarterly Report",
            "Text": "In this episode of MarketFoolery, host Chris Hill is joined by Motley Fool analyst Emily Flippen to discuss Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) cloud computing division being profitable for the first time ever. Also, Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) fourth-quarter results were mixed and UPS (NYSE:UPS) wraps up a very strong fiscal year. Emily analyzes those stories and shares why, despite a great year, UPS is in a precarious position.\n\nTo catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out our podcast center. To get started investing, check out our quick-start guide to investing in stocks. A full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on February 2, 2021.\n\nChris Hill: It's Tuesday, February 2nd. Happy Groundhog Day. Welcome to MarketFoolery. I'm Chris Hill. With me today, Emily Flippen. Good to see you.\n\nEmily Flippen: Hey, good to be here.\n\nHill: We've got pharmaceutical earnings, we've got some shipping and logistics earnings to get to, but we're going to start with some big e-commerce, and that's Alibaba. Third quarter profits and revenue, higher than expected. For the first time ever, Alibaba's cloud computing division was profitable. Based largely on that, Emily, I would have thought there would have been more enthusiasm for the stock. I would have thought we would have seen a rise out of Alibaba today. Instead, it's down 2%, 3% or so.\n\nFlippen: There's a couple of things to break down in this quarter. The important thing to note for investors is that a lot of what would have been enthusiasm for this quarter is muted because of the regulatory challenges that Jack Ma and Alibaba are going through right now. We saw a similar thing happen with Single's Day whose numbers were actually included in this past quarter. Alibaba more than doubled their Single's Day sales from the year prior, but was down on the news back in November, largely because of the concerns that investors had around how the Chinese government was going to handle Alibaba, a business that is increasingly considered to be a sense of a monopoly in the space. So there's some concerns there which have reflected, I believe, in the stock price movement that we're seeing today. But you've hit the nail on the head there with the excitement around Alibaba's cloud business. This is a small part of Alibaba's business. Nearly 90% of core revenue is still generated from their e-commerce operations. But seeing this business move toward profitability, that's adjusted EBITDA, so profitability is a loose term there. But seeing it move toward profitability makes a lot of investors think, \"Hey, maybe Alibaba's cloud business could be the next Amazon, the Amazon Web Services of China.\"\n\nHill: A lot of times, when we see a business in this situation, let's put the regulatory stuff aside. When we see a business that appears to be performing well, the stock isn't moving for one reason or another, a lot of times, we're looking toward the business and that's going to be something out of the business. Whatever that X is, we're looking for that to be the catalyst. It sounds like, based on what you said, the catalyst for Alibaba needs to come from the central government. I don't own shares of Alibaba, but for someone who looks at this business, looks at how dominant it is, looks at the fact that maybe their cloud computing division isn't going to be as big as Amazon Web Services, but maybe it becomes even a lesser version of Amazon Web Services, can move the needle on a stock. If a stock like Alibaba is on your watchlist, are you waiting for the central government to basically give, if not the green light, but at least, say, \"You know what? We're no longer or we're far less concerned about the regulatory stuff than we were. For whatever reason we decide, we're good with Alibaba now.\"\n\nFlippen: I don't think investors should wait for that exact moment to happen, because what we've seen with the way that the Chinese government has handled these issues in the past is that it's a slow tapering off of hostility. We never see a direct end to it. It just slowly falls out over a period of months to years. I expect we'll see that happen here with Alibaba. I actually think another reason that the stock could be muted, a thing that investors are looking for is more growth in the cloud business. We mentioned that it had positive adjusted EBITDA and it had a 50% increase year-over-year in terms of revenue from cloud, but that was still below expectations. The growth needs to continue to catalyze growth in general Alibaba when looking at its cloud performance. Because despite having 50% growth, investors were clearly looking for more here.\n\nHill: We got a mixed fourth quarter out of Pfizer. Profits were lower than expected, but revenue came in higher. Pfizer also raised guidance for the new fiscal year. What stood out to you?\n\nFlippen: What stood out to me was the $15 billion that Pfizer expects to generate from COVID vaccines in 2021, this is a number that financial media has really focused on as a catalyst for what could be a pretty significant portion of Pfizer's earnings heading into the next year. But even at $15 billion, that's still only 25% of the total revenue that's expected in 2021. There's a lot more to the Pfizer story than just looking at their COVID vaccine sales. But part of the reason investors could be excited here is not just because of that $15 billion, but also because the potential to develop new strains and new vaccines for different variants of COVID. Right now, Pfizer's in the process of developing a booster to fully help better protect against the new strains of coronavirus that we're seeing crop up across the world. But if they will need to continue to vaccinate people across the world for new strains, then that $15 billion that we expect in 2021 could become a sense of recurring revenue year after year, if they're having to develop new and new strains of the vaccine.\n\nHill: What do you think is a reasonable expectation for investors to have if they're thinking about buying shares of Pfizer? Because I'm struck by the fact that this is a nearly $200 billion company. Yet, you look over the past five years, this really has not been an impressive stock in terms of rewarding shareholders.\n\nFlippen: If investors are looking to buy Pfizer, they should be doing so because it has a really strong and steady dividend, recurring cash flow that they return to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. They should not be buying it because they expect for this to be the next growth company because of COVID vaccines. As I mentioned earlier, 75% of revenue is not expected to generate from coronavirus, which means that you have to look toward the existing drug pipeline as a good example of what type of growth you can expect in the future. That's important, because a lot of their sales are actually driven from drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, and one of their biggest drugs in the space is actually under investigation from the FDA for potentially serious side effects that were not known until late in 2020. So, that's the sort of thing that investors need to be digging deeper into with Pfizer, instead of just taking the coronavirus headline and expecting to get a growth company.\n\nHill: I know you are not at the point of life as an investor where you're necessarily looking to dividend paying stocks. You're much younger than I am, so you are much more focused on growth stocks. I will just say, in my experience, one of the great benefits of looking at a stock, buying shares of a dividend payer, and essentially allocating it in your portfolio and in your mind as 'you're a dividend payer, that's all I need you to do.' Just setting those expectations there, in my experience, any material growth you get out of those stocks is just wonderful. It's total icing on the cake. As long as they're paying the dividend, you're happy. So, it's good to have that context around Pfizer.\n\nLet's move on to UPS, which is wrapping up a really great fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue was nearly $25 billion. Shares of UPS up about 3% this morning. We'll get to their lack of guidance in a second, but this was just a monster year. You go back 12 months, and then the previous four or five years before that, UPS was like Pfizer. It was this big company sort of plugging along. The stock wasn't really moving in any significant way, and this caps off a great year.\n\nFlippen: There was a clear catalyst that happened in 2020 to explain why it was such a great year for UPS. Beyond just coronavirus, over 20% of all U.S. retail sales in 2020 happened online, which means that a lot of these businesses that were doing in-person sales suddenly had to pivot digital. We're suddenly using UPS and many different delivery alternatives a lot more than they were previously. In fact, when we dig into their quarter and you try to break down where a lot of the growth they saw this past quarter came from, it's actually not from large customers, it's from these small to medium-sized businesses. They were the true catalyst. Over the past quarter, they saw nearly 29% increase in total growth versus just 4% for what UPS considers their larger customers. A lot of that growth over 2020 and the past quarter came from these small businesses that were forced to digitally pivot during the coronavirus pandemic. It led to what was a pretty great quarter in terms of adjusted earnings. We can talk about that more deeply, but UPS saw over $2.5 in earnings per share, versus just over $2 expected. They beat pretty significantly on both the top and the bottom lines.\n\nHill: Should expectations change for UPS in the minds of investors? Because again, this was a company that was plugging along. We talk all the time about Boeing and Airbus being a duopoly. UPS is one of the few big players in this industry. I'm curious if you think that it's fair for investors, not necessarily to look at UPS and think, \"The 60% rise we saw in shares over the past 12 months, I'm expecting that every year from now on.\" I'm not suggesting that. I am asking though if it's fair to look at the rise in shipping, look at more and more retailers developing their online businesses, and saying, \"Yeah, it's absolutely fair to expect more out of UPS.\"\n\nFlippen: I'm actually not super excited about UPS as an investor. Part of that reason is because if you buy into the idea that the retail sales that digitally shifted this past year will continue to digitally shift in the future, in my opinion, there's a lot of retailers that are stronger in the value chain that you can buy into as opposed to buying UPS. The reason why I say that is because if you look at the metrics of UPS, it's really not that compelling in terms of scale. Over this past quarter, part of their growth was catalyzed by a nearly 8% increase in domestic shipping prices. That was the highest price growth they have seen in the past decade. Now, that would make some investors think to themselves, \"Well, here is some pricing power.\" As these businesses have to shift, they really need to pay whatever they can to get their products delivered to their customers, and that has led to an 8% increase in prices over the past year. But at the same time, if you look at the margins of UPS, their cost per piece was also up 8%. They weren't actually being super creative in terms of their bottom line when picking up this new business. When you look at that adjusted earnings per share, when you add back in all of these very real expenses for UPS, things like billions of dollars of cost for their pension plan, these are very real costs for investors which has led to an over $3 billion loss on their bottom line not adjusted. For all those reasons, I think if you're buying into the digital shift, which I think most investors are at this point, there's probably better businesses you can be invested in as opposed to UPS.\n\nHill: Is the lack of guidance unsettling to you at all? Because I truly don't know how to think about this. When I first saw that, they weren't giving any guidance for the new fiscal year, I thought, \"Boy, that seems a little troubling to me.\" I would think that maybe they would have the most insight and therefore they would be among the first companies to come out. But the more I think about it, maybe their guidance needs to be informed by the people whose packages they're shipping and so, maybe it's unfair to me to expect UPS to be on the front lines of large companies in the commerce space offering guidance.\n\nFlippen: UPS is stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to offering guidance. Investors expect guidance, maybe not for a quarter out, but for a year out. It's good to know that management has some plan about what to expect in the future. We saw this huge backlog of packages happen in the fourth quarter of 2020. If management doesn't have any expectations for what the next year could look like, how can we expect them to effectively manage their business? At the same time, if they issue expectations, if they issue guidance that is just clearly incorrect for what we see happen in 2021, which is really challenging to look at 2021 and say, \"Well, how much sales are going to go back in person?\" We don't know when people are going to be vaccinated. We don't know how people will respond once they're vaccinated. How will these new variants respond with people on how they live their lives? There's a lot of uncertainty in what UPS can expect over the next year, so I can understand the fear that comes from investors with a business that's supposed to be stable and predictable like UPS. The fact that management won't even issue guidance for the upcoming fiscal year, while at the same time, management needs to be really thoughtful about the fact that if they issue guidance, especially if that guidance ends up being misleading to investors, the fallout from that could potentially be worse than not issuing guidance at all.\n\nHill: This is one of the many reasons I enjoy talking with you, because you are so smart, thoughtful, and measured. In your smart, thoughtful, measured way, you just issued arguably one of the most damning indictments of UPS [laughs] and their management at a time when some people at UPS would be forgiven for popping champagne, by capping off their fiscal year with their shares up +60%. Here you come in with, again, smart, thoughtful, measured, not ranting. It's just like, \"No. No, it's really not that great and I'm really not interested.\"\n\nFlippen: Well, there's a first time for everything. I think you might be the first person who has ever told me that I'm measured or thoughtful in my responses. Hey, I appreciate that, Chris.\n\nHill: It's great talking to you, Emily, thanks for visiting.\n\nFlippen: Thanks for having me.\n\nHill: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear. That's going to do it for this edition of MarketFoolery. This show is mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Chris Hill, thanks for listening and we'll see you tomorrow."

            "Text": "In this article we are going to list the 10 best online brokers for non-US residents. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 5 best online brokers for non-US residents.\n\nAre you a US visa holder or a Non-US resident looking to invest into the US stock market? Finding a broker may seem complicated, but there are actually a few brokers out there that are by far the best brokers for Non-US residents which allow people from many countries to register. If you want to find out who are the best online brokers for non-us residents keep on reading so that you can be a part of the world of Non-US residents online trading soon enough!\n\nWhether you are a foreigner living in the United States or a citizen of another country in the world, the U.S. stock market is the go-to destination for all investing opportunities. Two of the most lucrative stock markets in the US include the NYSE and NASDAQ. Both markets offer US traders and investors a chance of buying and selling stock for publicly traded companies. Amongst many of the companies listed on the US Stock Exchange there are many you have probably heard of already. For example, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA), GameStop Corp Holding Company (NYSE:GME), Coca Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Pinterest Inc (NYSE:PINS), Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR) etc. Thanks to the success and high-profile trading engaged in US markets, non-US citizens have been wondering if they can trade in these markets too. The answer is yes. Currently, there are no regulations that stop online traders from trading in US markets.\n\n10 best online brokers for non US residents\n\nImage: Depositphotos\n\nTo participate in online trading, you will need to open an account with an online broker. The right choice for an online broker is essential if you want your trading to be profitable. So, what are online brokers and what can they do for you? An online broker is one which facilitates buying and selling of securities/assets over the Internet. The transactions are mostly done through the broker owned trading platforms. Online brokers began to gain popularity in the mid and late 1990s, facilitated by the development of high-performance computers and faster Internet connections.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy online trading? Well, trading is one of the most lucrative professions that anyone can engage in. It is convenient for many, as you can place orders, check quotes, and make changes from anywhere. It also facilitates faster execution of traders, helping to take advantage of the volatility in a better manner. By taking advantage of market discrepancies, it allows traders and investors an opportunity of implementing their strategies. Above all else, online trading is more cost-effective compared to trading through a traditional broker and the market offers some of the most desirable goals people could want like financial gain and more time to pursue hobbies.\n\nAs a non-US citizen who is interested in the US stock exchange, finding the right stockbroker can be super frustrating. For starters, you may end up selecting a broker who promises something he cannot deliver, and you end up in loss. Secondly, comparing brokers and finding the one suitable for you can be quite tricky. If you are a non-US citizen than you need to know that there are many rules and regulations surrounding the opening of a brokerage account. Before you open an account, it is wise to consult with the brokerage firm. There are firms that will allow online applications while others will require paper filings. Also, there are brokers who will demand for legitimate visa information and the W-8BEN form among other requirements.\n\nBefore considering an online broker, you should consider the factors outlined below:\n\nLet's first start with the products offered. It is important to consider the type of products offered by the broker. This should be relative to what may be geographically possible. For example, the online company may offer access to top stock markets like the London Stock Exchange, NYSE, and NASDAQ but not those markets of Japan and China. When it comes to products, look for a broker that will allow you to trade with all US stocks as well as mutual funds, forex, and futures, among others. Secondly, consider security. This is very important especially when it comes to your own funds. One feature to check out is the platform’s security. The firm must have an authentic SSL certificate. If they do have a valid SSL, their trading platform URL will be a secure one. It will start with https and not http. It is also important to consider what investor protection law you are under. Last comes pricing. You must look out for the brokers minimum balance, the fees you will have to pay per trade, due fee in case of inactivity. Other additional fees could be withdrawal fees and commissions. By researching pricing related matters, you will be able to select a brokerage firm that is within your budget.\n\nBy now you understand that an online broker should offer a reasonable minimum investment amount, trading platforms with top features, top customer service facilities and no additional account fees. Based on this criteria, we have outlined the brokerage firms below that make it on our list of the 10 best online brokers for non-US residents.\n\nBrokerage firms and investment companies have been evaluated based on their provided services that are important to various types of investors. Such as for active traders, online brokers with low to no commissions and hi-tech mobile trading platforms are most ideal. For people venturing into online trading for their very first time, online brokers that provide educational resources, research and customer services like on-call chat and phone support have been added to the list.

            "Text": "Bloomberg\n\n(Bloomberg) -- There is nothing about the finances of Blink Charging Co. that would suggest it’s one of the hottest stocks in America.It’s never posted an annual profit in its 11-year history; it warned last year it could go bankrupt; it’s losing market share, pulls in anemic revenue and has churned through management in recent years.And yet a hot stock it is. Investors have bid Blink’s share price up 3,000% over the past eight months. Only seven stocks -- out of about 2,700 that are worth at least $1 billion -- have risen more over that time. The reason: Blink is a green-energy company, an owner and operator of charging stations that power up electric vehicles. And if investors are certain of one thing in the mania that is sweeping through financial markets, it is that green companies are can’t-miss, must-own investments of the future.No stock better captures this euphoria than Blink. With a market capitalization of $2.17 billion as of Monday, its enterprise value-to-sales ratio -- a common metric to gauge whether a stock is overvalued -- has blown out to 481. For some context, at Tesla Inc. -- the darling of the EV world and a company with a very rich valuation itself -- that number is just 26.“Everything about it is wrong,” said Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research. “It is just a cute name which caught the eye of retail investors.”Citron was one of a handful of firms that bet against Blink last year, putting on short-sale trades that would pay off if the share price fell. It’s one of several wagers against stocks favored by the retail-investment crowd that have gone against Citron -- with GameStop Corp. being the most high-profile -- and prompted Left to declare Jan. 29 that the firm was abandoning its research into short-selling targets. Overall short interest on Blink -- a gauge of the amount of wagers against the stock -- has fallen to under 25% of free-floating shares from more than 40% in late December.For the short-sellers, one of the things that raised alarms is that several figures tied to Blink, including CEO and Chairman Michael Farkas, were linked to companies that ran afoul of securities regulations years ago.Farkas dismisses this and the other criticisms lobbied by the shorts. “There have been and always will be naysayers,” Farkas said in an email. “When I founded the business, the naysayers questioned whether the shift to EV was real. Now, as the value of our business grows, the naysayers tend to be the short sellers.”Also See: Bloomberg Intelligence’s Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance DashboardIn the CrosshairsMaking money on charging is, historically, a losing proposition. In theory, a model like Blink’s that involves both equipment sales and collecting user fees could become consistently profitable as government support accelerates EV adoption. But no one’s done it yet.“This market is still too small and early-stage,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James & Associates. “It will take time for economies of scale to materialize.”Even by the industry’s fairly forgiving standards, Blink’s revenue is meager, totaling an estimated $5.5 million in 2020. ChargePoint Inc., which announced plans to go public via a special purpose acquisition company last year, generated $144.5 million in revenue in 2020, according to a January filing. EVgo Services LLC, which is nearing a similar deal to go public through a SPAC, has a smaller charging network than Blink but more than double the sales -- an estimated $14 million in 2020. Despite the wildly different revenue figures, all three companies have an enterprise value of between $2.1 billion and $2.4 billion.Blink warned in a May filing that its finances “raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within a year,” a required disclosure when a company doesn’t have enough cash on hand for 18 months of expenses.“Electric is real. The stock prices of companies in the space are not,” said Erik Gordon, an assistant professor at University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. “The dot-com boom produced some real companies, but most of the overpriced dot-com companies were lousy investments. The electric boom will be the same story. Some great companies will be built, but most of the investors who chase insanely-priced companies will be crying.”Still, the recent market boom has breathed new life into Blink, allowing it to raise $232.1 million though a share offering in January. Roth Capital Partners as recently as Friday recommended buying the stock, giving it a price target of $67, 29% above the current level.Shares fell 2.3% to $52.10 in New York Monday.The company’s prospects rely on exponential EV growth, and Farkas in January discussed plans to deploy roughly 250,000 chargers “over the next several years” and often touts the company’s ability to generate recurring revenue from its network.Currently, the company says it has 6,944 charging stations in its network. An internal map of Blink’s public fleet lists about 3,700 stations available in the U.S. By contrast, ChargePoint boasts a global public and private charging network that’s more than 15 times larger.Unlike some of its competitors, Blink’s revenue model hinges in part on driving up utilization rates, which for now remain in the “low-single-digits,” too scant to generate significant revenue, Farkas said during a November earnings call. He told Bloomberg that use will increase as EVs become more popular.For most chargers in operation now, utilization probably must reach 10%-15% to break even, although profitability depends on many other factors such as a company’s business model, electricity rates and capital costs, according to BloombergNEF Senior Associate Ryan Fisher.Blink was an early market leader among charging companies but has lost its lead and now controls about 4% of the sector in Level 2 public charging, said Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, an electric car consulting and policy firm.Blink has also acknowledged “material weaknesses” over its financial reporting, disclosed in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings dating back to 2011. The company says it has hired an accounting consultant to review its controls and is making necessary changes.Origin StoryBlink’s colorful origin story has been a prime target of short-sellers. It traces back to 2006 when it formed as shell company New Image Concepts Inc. to provide “top-drawer” personal consulting services related to grooming, wardrobe and entertainment, according to an SEC filing.In December 2009, the company entered a share exchange agreement with Car Charging Inc. Farkas joined the company as CEO in 2010, after working as a stockbroker and investing in companies including Skyway Communications Holding Corp., which the SEC deemed a “pump-and-dump scheme” during the years Farkas held shares. (Farkas said he was a passive investor, was unaware of any misdeeds and “had no involvement in any capacity in the activities of Skyway.”)In 2013, Farkas oversaw Car Charging’s $3.3 million purchase of bankrupt Ecotality, which had received more than $100 million in U.S. Department of Energy grants to install chargers nationwide. The company later changed its name to Blink.Since then, Blink has been plagued by executive turnover, with three of five board members departing between November 2018 and November 2019. The company has had two chief financial officers and three chief operating officers since 2017. One former COO, James Christodoulou, was fired in March 2020. He sued the company, accusing it of potential securities violations, and reached a settlement with Blink, which denied any wrongdoing, for $400,000 in October.Financier Justin Keener, a one-time major Blink shareholder whose capital assisted the company’s 2018 Nasdaq listing, and the company he operated were charged last year for failing to register as a securities dealer while allegedly selling billions of penny-stock shares unrelated to Blink. He said he has since divested from Blink and now owns “a relatively small number of common shares” as a result of a settlement of a warrant dispute with the company. Keener denies the SEC allegations.Farkas told Bloomberg he has cut all ties to Keener, was unaware of any investigations going on while they worked together and has no knowledge of any wrongdoing by Keener.The surging stock has brought a windfall to Farkas, Blink’s largest shareholder. On Jan. 12, after shares rallied to records, he sold $22 million of stock, according to Bloomberg data. Farkas’s total compensation, including stock awards, totaled $6.5 million from 2016 to 2019, equivalent to more than half the company’s revenue. Included in his 2018 compensation were $394,466 in commissions to Farkas Group Inc., a third-party entity he controlled that Blink hired to install chargers.Farkas said his compensation is justified given that he had personally invested in the company’s formation and had for many years received shares in lieu of salary.More recently, Blink board member Donald Engel followed the CEO’s lead.He sold more than $18 million of shares during the past two weeks.(Updates share price in 15th paragraph and market value in fourth.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Date": "2021-02-08",
            "Headline": "SoftBank’s Vision Fund Profit Undercut by Trading Losses",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. reported a record profit in its Vision Fund as a surging stock market lifted the value of its portfolio companies, but founder Masayoshi Son wiped out a significant chunk of those gains with his controversial trading in derivatives.\n\nThe Vision Fund reported a 844.1 billion yen ($8 billion) profit in the December quarter, surpassing record numbers set just a quarter earlier. A global rally in technology shares has boosted the value of SoftBank’s stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and paved the way for initial public offerings from the likes of DoorDash Inc.\n\nThose gains, which had been widely expected, were offset by fallout from Son’s decision last year to start dabbling in trading stocks and options. SoftBank posted a 285.3 billion yen derivatives loss in the period. That led to an overall loss in the asset management arm of 113.5 billion yen, up from 85.2 billion yen in the previous three-month period.\n\n“The Vision Fund’s stellar performance in the past few quarters continues to cover for the losses on options trading,” said Anthea Lai, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “SoftBank could argue those derivatives were for hedging purposes, but Son’s venture into trading is definitely not looking good so far.”\n\nIn a presentation to investors after the results, Son focused on his successes. He reprised his argument that SoftBank is like a goose that lays golden eggs, from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo! two decades ago, to companies like Uber and DoorDash more recently. Some 15 companies have gone public from the Vision Fund so far, he said.“Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,” he said, pacing a stage in a white turtleneck sweater and grey jacket. “We are finally in the harvesting stage.”\n\nHe said Vision Fund 1 and Vision Fund 2 have invested in a total of 131 companies. In the case of DoorDash, SoftBank invested about $680 million for a stake now worth about $9 billion, he said, while its $7.7 billion investment in Uber is worth $11.3 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Tokyo-based company had a net income of 1.17 trillion yen in the December period and did not release operating profit figures. At least six more portfolio companies are planning IPOs this year.\n\n“There is a lot of liquidity out there and investors are particularly partial toward tech stocks,” Justin Tang, head of Asian research at United First Partners in Singapore. “At some point the IPO fatigue sets in, but doesn’t seem like we are there yet. For now, the window of opportunity is open for SoftBank.”\n\nAfter shares plunged in March with the coronavirus outbreak, SoftBank unveiled plans to sell off 4.5 trillion yen of assets to reduce debt and fund buybacks. The selloff included part of its interests in Alibaba, T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the Japan telecommunications unit. SoftBank also announced a deal to sell its chip designer Arm Ltd. to Nvidia Corp. for $40 billion.\n\nSoftBank held a total of $22 billion of “highly liquid listed stocks” as of the end of quarter, including a $7.39 billion investment in Amazon.com Inc., $3.28 billion in Facebook Inc. and $1.38 billion in Alphabet Inc. The operation is managed by its asset management subsidiary SB Northstar, where Son personally holds a 33% stake.\n\nThe investments were accompanied by derivatives that amplified exposure, but SoftBank has been winding down its options strategy amid a backlash from investors. The fair value of SoftBank’s futures and options positions came to little over $1 billion at the end of December, compared with $2.7 billion the previous quarter. Long call options on listed stocks have dwindled to $1.68 billion from $4.69 billion and short call options on listed stocks declined to $238 million from $1.26 billion of value.\n\nSon said that the losses in the asset management arm have swung to a profit of about 100 billion yen since the end of last quarter. But the operations remain in a “test-drive stage,” he said.\n\nAlibaba, Son’s most stark investment success to date and SoftBank’s largest asset, saw its shares plunge about 20% last quarter amid a Chinese government clampdown that scuttled the planned listing of its affiliate Ant Group Co. Founder Jack Ma had all but vanished from public view, prompting investor unease before he resurfaced last month.\n\nSon said he remained in touch with Ma, without giving specific details of their communications. He said Ma likes to draw and shares his drawings with Son via chat; the SoftBank chief also sketches but hasn’t shared any of his work. Son also said he saw the increased antitrust scrutiny of Ma’s businesses in China as part of the country’s natural evolution.\n\nSoftBank’s own sale of Arm to Nvidia is still making its way through the approval process gauntlet. The United Kingdom and European Union are both preparing to launch probes into the deal, the Financial Times reported last week. Son said he remained confident that it will receive a green light at the end.\n\nSoftBank has also joined the blank-check company frenzy with plans for several special purpose acquisition companies. SVF Investment Corp. raised $525 million last month to address sectors like mobile communications technology, artificial intelligence, robotics, cloud technologies and software. LDH Growth Corp I plans to raise as much as $200 million to target Latin American and Hispanic markets.\n\nSoftBank last week filed for two more SPACs, seeking to raise another $630 million. The new SoftBank vehicles, SVF Investment Corp. 2 and 3, will target the same diverse areas of technology as the first, including mobile communications and artificial intelligence, according to filings Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n“Consistently good performance by Vision Fund portfolio companies also helps the SPAC’s prospects because investors can extrapolate management expertise,” said Tang at United First Partners. “It underlines their skill in deploying capital.”\n\nSoftBank may see between 10 to 20 public listings a year from its portfolio of 164 startups across three different funds, Son said. A typical early-stage venture capital fund might see a third of its bets pay off, but SoftBank’s portfolio of late-stage companies should do better than that, he said. Even WeWork has received SPAC interest, he said.\n\nThe billionaire struck a tone that was reminiscent of the days before the WeWork fiasco in late 2019. He said the key to turning “white egg” investments into golden egg hits was “turbo-charging” startups with “overwhelming capital,” more ambitious goals and synergies with other portfolio companies.\n\nSon’s presentation then took a turn for the comical. He flipped to an animated slide of a goose tagged with “AI revolution” text and a line of golden eggs marching out of its backside to Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker.\n\n“Investment is a rhythm,” Son said. “But please don’t look at this too seriously.”\n\n(Updates with Son’s comments on Alibaba, derivatives from 12th paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Text": "Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) recently posted fiscal third-quarter numbers that easily beat analysts' expectations. The Chinese tech giant's revenue rose 37% year over year to 221.1 billion yuan ($33.9 billion), topping estimates by $530 million. Its adjusted earnings increased 21% year over year to $3.38 per ADS -- which also surpassed expectations by $0.13.\n\nThe company revealed that its cloud business, which grew 50% year over year to 16.1 billion yuan ($2.5 billion) during the quarter, was finally profitable after bleeding red ink for over a decade.\n\nThat revelation might instantly spark comparisons between Alibaba Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the profitable cloud infrastructure platform that supports the U.S. e-commerce giant's online marketplace. But such comparisons would be flawed, since Alibaba Cloud is not nearly as profitable as AWS.\n\nDecoding Alibaba's definition of \"profitability\"\n\nAt first glance, Alibaba's cloud computing results don't seem to make any sense. The segment's operating loss actually widened year over year from 1.8 billion yuan to 2.0 billion yuan ($313.3 million) in the fiscal third quarter.\n\nBut on an adjusted EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization) basis, Alibaba Cloud squeezed out a slim \"profit\" of 24 million yuan ($3.7 million). That total also excludes the unit's stock-based compensation expenses, which rose 41% to 2.1 billion yuan ($316.2 million).\n\nTherefore, it's unlikely that Alibaba Cloud will turn profitable on a GAAP basis anytime soon. But investors shouldn't dismiss the strengths of this business as revenue rose 56% in the first nine months of 2020, and its adjusted EBITA loss narrowed significantly over the same period:\n\nFiscal Year 2019 2020 Nine Months Ended\n\nDec. 31, 2020 Revenue $3.68 billion $5.65 billion $6.65 billion Operating Income ($821 million) ($991 million) ($1.17 billion) Adjusted EBITA ($172 million) ($199 million) ($72 million)\n\nAlibaba also controlled 40.9% of China's cloud infrastructure market in the third quarter of 2020, according to Canalys, putting it far ahead of Huawei Cloud (16.2%), Tencent Cloud (15.8%), and Baidu's AI Cloud (7.1%).\n\nDuring the earnings call, CFO Maggie Wu attributed cloud growth in the quarter to robust demand from China's \"internet, retail and public sectors.\" Wu noted that Alibaba Cloud's ongoing infrastructure investments, along with its massive scale, enabled it to turn profitable on an adjusted EBITA basis, but she didn't address the unit's rising stock-based compensation expense or widening operating losses.\n\nDon't confuse Alibaba Cloud with AWS\n\nAlibaba is often compared to Amazon, but the two tech giants operate completely different business models.\n\nAWS is firmly profitable, and its growth supports Amazon's lower-margin retail business. Meanwhile, Alibaba generates all of its profits from its higher-margin \"core commerce\" business, which supports the expansion of its unprofitable cloud, digital media, and innovation initiatives segments.\n\nThe company usually generates stable growth, but its core commerce business has been depending heavily on its lower-margin segments -- including brick-and-mortar stores, direct sales channels, cross-border marketplaces, and its Cainiao logistics unit -- to mask the slowing growth of its higher-margin Taobao and Tmall marketplaces in China.\n\nThat's why the core commerce segment's adjusted EBITA margin fell seven percentage points to 34% during the latest quarter, which drove company-wide adjusted EBITA margin down almost four points to 28%.\n\nAlibaba probably won't be able to strengthen its core commerce margins near term, especially as China's antitrust regulators probe its e-commerce marketplaces, so it needs Alibaba Cloud to pick up the slack. That effort might partly offset the ongoing erosion of its core commerce profitability, but investors shouldn't expect Alibaba Cloud to become an AWS-like profit engine anytime soon.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThe growth of Alibaba's cloud business is encouraging, but investors should remember three things: Its revenue growth will likely decelerate in the future; its stock-based compensation is rising; and it's only profitable if you exclude those and other expenses.\n\nLooking ahead, investors should track Alibaba's progress in expanding the cloud segment's EBITA and how well that business can relieve the growing pressure on its core commerce business. If the company fails to execute this balancing act, its earnings growth will suffer."

            "Date": "2021-02-08",
            "Headline": "Tencent's Battle With ByteDance Could Attract Antitrust Regulators",
            "Text": "ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant that owns TikTok, recently sued its larger rival Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) over alleged antitrust violations. ByteDance says Tencent blocked users on its WeChat and QQ apps -- which host 1.21 billion and 617 million mobile monthly active users, respectively -- from accessing content from Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok.\n\nByteDance claims Tencent is blocking Douyin to promote WeChat's own short video channels, and it's asking for 90 million yuan ($14 million) in damages. Let's see how ByteDance's lawsuit could cause headaches for Tencent, which is already being scrutinized by antitrust regulators in China.\n\nTrying to spark an antitrust probe\n\nOver the past few months, China's SAMR (State Administration for Market Regulation) tightened its grip on the country's top tech companies. It fined Tencent and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) over unapproved acquisitions last December, and recently introduced new rules to rein in China's two largest payment platforms, Tencent's WeChat Pay and Alibaba-backed AliPay.\n\nThe SAMR launched an antitrust probe into Alibaba's e-commerce business in late December, and demanded that its marketplaces end their exclusive deals with merchants and aggressive pricing strategies. Complaints from Alibaba's rivals, including JD.com and Pinduoduo, reportedly sparked that probe.\n\nByteDance likely wants to spark a similar antitrust probe against Tencent. Douyin currently reaches over 400 million daily active users in China, but it's still much smaller than WeChat and QQ.\n\nUnderstanding Tencent's strategies\n\nQQ, Tencent's older messaging platform, is gradually shrinking. But WeChat -- a monolithic app that hosts millions of integrated \"Mini Programs\" for online shopping, payments, food deliveries, ride-hailing services, online news, games, music, and more -- is still growing.\n\nTencent considers popular apps that pull users away from that walled garden, including ByteDance's Douyin and its news app Jinri Toutiao, to be long-term threats -- especially if it offers its own competing app or feature within WeChat.\n\nTencent previously barred WeChat's users from posting links to Jinri Toutiao's news stories. Tencent also didn't approve ByteDance's WeChat Mini Programs for its cloud-based office platform, Feishu. That's why it wasn't surprising when Tencent finally cut its users off from Douyin's videos.\n\nTencent likely cut off those apps to protect Tencent News, Tencent Cloud Office, and WeChat's short video channels from ByteDance's apps. Those moves certainly seem anti-competitive, and could cause the SAMR to closely scrutinize the relationship between WeChat, its integrated features, and Tencent's other mobile apps.\n\nIt's not about the money, it's about sending a message\n\nByteDance generated $37 billion in revenue last year, according to The Information, so a $14 million settlement would be a drop in the bucket. It also won't matter much to Tencent, which generated nearly $54 billion in revenue in the first nine months of 2020. Therefore, ByteDance's latest lawsuit against Tencent isn't really about the money -- it's about drawing regulators to Tencent.\n\nByteDance has sued Tencent before, but none of those legal challenges have been definitely resolved yet. However, its latest lawsuit represents the first time it openly accused Tencent of violating \"antitrust laws\" -- which could certainly get the SAMR's attention.\n\nWhat's at stake for Tencent?\n\nAnalysts expect Tencent's revenue and earnings per share to rise 38% and 49%, respectively, this year. Next year, they expect its revenue and EPS to grow another 24% and 18%, respectively, as its gaming, advertising, social networking, fintech, and business services units all continue to generate double-digit percentage sales growth.\n\nBased on those expectations, Tencent's stock still looks reasonably valued at about 40 times forward earnings -- even after it rallied nearly 90% over the past 12 months. However, analysts could quickly reduce those estimates if the SAMR drops the hammer on Tencent as it did on Alibaba.\n\nTherefore, Tencent's investors should keep close tabs on these developments, which could spark a full-blown crisis if other companies follow ByteDance's lawsuit lead."

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

            "Date": "2021-02-09",
            "Headline": "How One Woman Turned a $40 Million Kuaishou Bet Into $12 Billion",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- In 2014, as their video app Kuaishou began to take off, Su Hua and his co-founders started looking for money to expand. They quickly got a proposal from Ruby Lu, a venture investor who had spotted them earlier as promising engineers and given them feedback on previous businesses.\n\nBut Lu’s proposal was trumped by a larger venture firm with a much higher offer, according to people familiar with the matter. She refused to concede. Lu pitched Su and his team that she would give them more than money, offering her personal engagement and the support of her partners at DCM Ventures. She won, even with a lower offer.\n\nOn Friday, Kuaishou Technology started trading in Hong Kong after the biggest initial share sale for an internet company since Uber Technologies Inc. in 2019. By any yardstick, Lu’s investment has been a home run: the roughly $40 million that DCM put into Kuaishou is now worth about $14 billion after the stock more than tripled over its first three days.\n\n“There is a methodology in building a company from scratch,” said Lu, 50, in her first interview in years. Part of her strategy is to identify talented engineers like Su, but they also need to have the right strategy and mindset. “You have to endure more pain than the usual person.”\n\nLu belongs to an unusual group of female investors who have risen to the forefront of China’s venture capital world. In 2019, she started her own firm, Atypical Ventures, which seeks to groom China’s next generation of tech darlings using finance from U.S. institutional investors.\n\nIt was the next step in a life spent as a bridge between the two countries, which started when an American couple invited her to live with them in Maryland and ended up paying for her undergraduate education. Then came a stint working on IPOs at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s investment bank at the height of the dot-com bubble, and later a pivot into startup investing.\n\nShe’s “such a positive force for the Chinese venture community,” said Kai-Fu Lee, chief executive officer of venture-capital firm Sinovation Ventures, who has known Lu for years. “She will help you when you’re winning, she will help you when you’re losing.”\n\nStory continues\n\nIt all started in 1989, when Lu bumped into Fred and Virginia Pausch on the streets of Xiamen, the southeastern Chinese port city where she grew up. The couple, in town to help with English language instruction, took a liking to her, inviting her to live with them and study in the U.S. Lu’s parents gave permission -- provided the teenager herself collect more than 30 approvals needed to travel overseas. When she succeeded, her mother sewed $200 into her underwear in case she needed to escape.\n\n“It would have been impossible for anyone else,” said Tammy Pausch, the daughter of the couple. “With Ruby almost nothing is impossible.”\n\nHer new “brother” in the U.S. was Randy Pausch, who went on to become a computer-science professor famous for his “Last Lecture.” He often said he won the “parent lottery.”\n\nLu’s English was poor when she arrived and she understood little in her classes. So Fred Pausch got her a tape recorder she could use to review lectures at home. She finished top of her class in economics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, then did a master’s in international studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nShe got a job in Goldman’s investment bank in 1996, first working from Hong Kong to help China’s state-owned companies go public and later moving to the U.S. It was eBay Inc.’s IPO that hooked her on technology, prompting her to change her focus and relocate to Goldman’s tech division in Menlo Park, California. “After that there was no return,” she said.\n\nLu left Goldman in 2003 to join DCM Ventures, the Silicon Valley firm set up by David Chao and Dixon Doll. There, she co-founded DCM’s China business to capture what she calls “time and geographic arbitrage,” in which ideas that had worked in Silicon Valley were adopted in China. At that time, Chinese tech giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. were still in their early years. Some of Lu’s top investments at DCM followed this pattern, such as the Amazon-style e-commerce site Dangdang and the online car dealer Bitauto.\n\nBut her biggest success is a very different story. Kuaishou, like its rival TikTok owned by ByteDance Ltd., is a Chinese idea that’s gone global. The two outfits -- both started less than a decade ago -- pioneered the live-streaming and bite-sized video format that’s since been adopted around the world by the likes of Facebook Inc. and YouTube.\n\nKuaishou’s Su was on her radar long before he built the short-video app. They became friendly while Su was developing an AI-based ad recommendation system for Chinese search leader Baidu Inc. After Su left Baidu, Lu didn’t hesitate to back his ventures, first an online bazaar for second-hand goods -- which didn’t come to fruition -- and then Kuaishou, which at the time had fewer than 15 people and zero revenue.\n\nLu sat on the board until she left DCM in 2016, and the venture firm subsequently invested more in Kuaishou, but the high return is largely thanks to her early bet. DCM, which now holds a 7.6% stake in Kuaishou, is its first and largest international venture investor. China’s 5Y Capital, which was previously called Morningside Venture Capital, put in about $204 million that was worth about $26 billion as of Tuesday’s close.\n\nYou need to know “the top technology players, the best engineers in town,” Lu said on the importance of personal relationships. “Many of the entrepreneurs I backed, when they wanted to leave their company, I would say I will give you money.”\n\nLu set up Atypical Ventures in September 2019 after a brief spell at another venture capital firm. The name stems from her belief that entrepreneurs must be different from the norm, ready to go through tough times and delay gratification on the long road to building a big business. Its first fund raised $200 million from U.S. pension funds, endowments and billionaire families.\n\nAtypical makes concentrated bets in a small number of startups -- so far just five -- and sees its role as supporting entrepreneurs. Lu said she has a personal rule of replying to messages from entrepreneurs within three hours, and often takes emergency calls from them in the early hours.\n\nCompany founders who’ve worked with her say she’s high in integrity, straight-talking and driven to succeed.\n\n“She is very, very determined,” said Stanley Li, the founder of Chinese online health-care unicorn DXY, which DCM backed.\n\nLi first met Lu in Beijing in 2010 after she cold-called him. He described the meeting as like a kidnapping. While he enjoyed her conversation, he declined to take her offer because the entrepreneur was about to close a fundraising round with another investor.\n\n“She wouldn’t let us go,” Li recalled with a laugh. “Ruby told us we weren’t allowed to leave the room unless we signed a deal.”\n\nBy the next morning, Li had agreed. DCM invested $2 million in the first fundraising round and later put in more money. It still holds its stake. The company’s valuation passed the $1 billion mark in 2018.\n\nSome of Lu’s relationships were decades in the making. In the 1990s, Victor Perlroth and his friend were looking for a roommate in Portola Valley, near where he was studying at Stanford University. He put an ad in the newspaper and Ruby replied.\n\nTen years later, the two started working together when Perlroth wanted to start a biotech firm but struggled to find backers. So he raised money from friends and family, including a personal investment from Lu. Kodiak Sciences Inc., the company he founded, went public in 2018 and is worth more than $8 billion. Lu probably made a 100-fold return on her investment, according to Perloth.\n\n“She has an energy,” Perlroth said. “She’s very talkative, curious, friendly. What you see is what you get.”\n\nLu is unusual in her unwillingness to let startups go under. Most venture firms walk away from losers quickly so they can spend time on winners. “She does not accept even one failure,” said Sinovation’s Lee.\n\nIn one case, a startup was floundering and every other board member was ready to give up. Lu worked overtime to find a buyer, making investors a small return, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nOf the 20-plus startups she has invested in throughout her career, only one has been written off, far below the typical 30% to 40% failure rate. Eight had IPOs.\n\nWhile Lu has had big successes, she also has regrets. They include missing out on ByteDance because she didn’t see enough potential to monetize the company’s first breakout hit -- the news aggregator app Toutiao.

            "Headline": "Temasek’s New Chief Is Upbeat on Long-Term Chinese Investments",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Temasek Holdings Pte.’s newly appointed Chief Executive Officer Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara said Singapore’s state-owned investment firm is committed to China despite recent developments such as the cancellation of Ant Financial Group’s public listing.\n\n“We’re still very positive on the long-term trajectory of China from what we can see,” Pillay said, when asked about China Tuesday by reporters after he was named to replace Ho Ching, who will step down in October after 17 years as head of the $230 billion firm.\n\nPillay, currently head of Temasek’s international unit, will need to steer one of the world’s biggest institutional investors through markets buffeted by the coronavirus pandemic and rising political tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nTemasek is a leading investor in China with deals running the gamut from fast-growing startups and technology giants to banking institutions. In September it said holdings in China had surpassed those its home market for the first time, hitting 29% of total portfolio value as it added to assets despite the increased geopolitical tensions. Temasek was also an early investor in fintech giant Ant, whose record initial public offering was scrapped by regulators on the eve of the November listing.\n\n“China has always had that long-term potential for us, going back to even before I joined Temasek to the decade where I have been very much involved in our strategy,” he said, highlighting its biotech, consumer and enterprise sectors as emerging areas of interest.\n\nThe change in leadership comes at a critical time for Temasek, which owns investments throughout the world from Chinese technology giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to asset manager BlackRock Inc. Its net portfolio value fell for the first time in four years to S$306 billion ($230 billion) last fiscal year, after financial markets crashed during the early phase of the pandemic in March.\n\nPillay spent much of the briefing discussing Temasek’s commitment to sustainability and adapting to the impact of climate change on its businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nHo, 67, who is married to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, will stay in her role until October, with Pillay keeping his position as CEO of the Temasek International Pte unit after the changes take effect.\n\nHo’s resignation was long-expected and attempted once before in 2009 when former BHP Billiton Ltd. CEO Chip Goodyear was announced as her successor. Temasek abandoned that plan just four months into the transition, citing “differences regarding certain strategic issues that could not be resolved” while Singapore’s then-finance minister said the role would “ideally” go to a Singaporean.\n\nPillay, a 57-year-old Cambridge-educated lawyer, was widely regarded as a candidate to succeed Ho when he was promoted to his current role almost two years ago. The Singaporean joined Temasek in 2010, holding various leadership roles including heading the investment and portfolio management groups and overseeing the U.S. and Americas market teams. He also initiated and led the Enterprise Development Group, helping to build new longer-term growth engines for the firm.\n\n“I don’t see the impending changes at Temasek as having any significant near-term impact on the way Temasek Holdings is run or the way it manages its portfolio,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking in Singapore. “Singapore Inc. is always about continuity, but yet always on the lookout for emerging themes that can reinforce Singapore as a key hub for businesses.”\n\nDifferent Kind\n\nAndrew Delios, a professor at NUS Business School, said Temasek had performed well as a steward of Singapore’s finances over the long term. Its 20-year compounded and annualized return stood at 6% as of March 2020, and has returned 14% a year since inception in 1974.\n\n“Temasek is a much different kind of company where stability, predictability and consistency are important,” he said, while adding the views were his own. “I don’t think we’ll see any change of substance for the next two years.”\n\nTemasek massively stepped up investing abroad under Ho. Foreign investments made up 76% of its portfolio as of March, up from 48% in 2004.\n\nBut the firm faces tremendous challenges in the years ahead. Some of its biggest assets were inherited from the state and are being pummeled by markets damped by the spread of Covid-19. Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., have dropped more than 25% over the past 12 months.\n\nSome of the fund’s foreign holdings have fared better, with BlackRock up 31% in the period, and PayPal Holdings Inc. more than doubling. However, many of these are now potentially susceptible to the rift between the U.S. and China.\n\nHo joined Temasek in May 2002 as executive director, and was appointed CEO two years later. She started her career as an engineer and worked at the country’s Ministry of Defence, later becoming the president and CEO of Singapore Technologies Group prior to joining Temasek.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Date": "2021-02-09",
            "Headline": "Wall Street Is Investing Billions to Scale Tiny Mom-and-Pop Sellers on Amazon",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Some of the biggest names on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley—JPMorgan Chase, Advent International, Khosla Ventures among them—are pumping billions of dollars into mom-and-pops selling everything from tea kettles to jock itch remedies on Amazon.com Inc.\n\nInvestment banks, venture firms and private equity shops are backing so-called Amazon aggregators—often led by e-commerce veterans—that are betting they can take up-and-coming sellers, who often operate out of their garages, and transform them into global brands. The aggregators say they have the expertise to select strong products and avoid faddish ones that flame out before they have a chance to grow.\n\nThe latest entrant, Branded Group, said Tuesday it had purchased 20 houseware and leisure brands. Formed last summer and flush with $150 million raised by the Berlin venture firm Target Global, Branded will be run by Pierre Poignant, who previously led the southeast Asian online marketplace Lazada, and Michael Ronen, who spent almost 20 years in mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs and was a founding partner of SoftBank’s Vision Fund.\n\n“We want to be a multi-billion dollar company,” says Poignant, who oversaw the sale of Lazada to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Poignant acknowledges that “buying businesses is one thing. Scaling them is another.”\n\nAbout 40 Amazon aggregators have emerged in the past few years, according to people following the trend, with most of them still quietly seeking deals behind the scenes. Eight have announced fundraising rounds totaling more than $2.5 billion since 2019.\n\nThrasio, launched in 2018, has the deepest pockets and has already purchased 90 companies with $1.75 billion in funding and debt from backers that include the private-equity firm Advent International. Perch, founded in 2020, has raised $130 million and gobbled up almost 30 brands. Several private equity firms have launched websites to court Amazon sellers without disclosing how much they’ve designated to buy them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe demand for Amazon mom-and-pops reflects the maturation of the e-commerce giant’s third-party marketplace, which accounts for more than half of all products sold on the site. The web store has grown so large that deep-pocketed investors can prospect for tomorrow's big hit among the millions of merchants competing on the site. “The emergence of these companies reflects how selling with Amazon offers small businesses powerful opportunities to build their brands and reach millions of customers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in an email.\n\nThrasio, based in Walpole, Massachusetts, was early to the game but has attracted well-financed competition since the pandemic pushed millions of consumers online, possibly changing shopping habits forever. The news that Thrasio had surpassed a $1 billion valuation in June pulled in even more investors.\n\nAggregators look for consistent money-makers with annual sales up to about $10 million; they generally offer three to four times a target’s annual profit, including the salary the owners pay themselves. The buyers don’t focus on specific categories the way a Procter & Gamble Co. does but are content to jam together a potpourri of brands. Perch, for example, sells maternity belts, auto upholstery tools, peppermint-based athlete’s foot cures and virtual-reality headsets.\n\nThe synergies happen on the back-end, where experts in global logistics, search engine optimization and Amazon advertising can apply their knowhow to any profitable product with good reviews. Beyond expertise, the aggregators have the funds mom-and-pop businesses often lack to expand internationally. The aggregators also consolidate their purchasing power with manufacturers and shipping companies to negotiate lower prices.\n\n“Amazon sellers are salivating right now because all of these investors are lining up around the block to buy them,” says James Thomson, a former Amazon executive who now advises online merchants. “Many many more aggregators will emerge before this starts to slow down.”\n\nThe gold rush is happening despite perceptions that Amazon is a hostile environment where merchants can be kicked off after a few bad reviews or bogus counterfeiting charges and sometimes spend months trying to get reinstated. Over the years, some sellers have built decent businesses only to watch Amazon start selling its own versions of their products.\n\nThe aggregators say those risks are real but worth taking given the potential rewards of being on a site that captures almost 40 cents of every dollar spent online in the U.S., a figure they expect to keep growing even as stores reopen and people get vaccinated for Covid-19.\n\nTheir north star is Anker Innovations Technology Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that started selling cell phone chargers on Amazon and grew into a global electronics brand worth more than $10 billion whose products have graduated from Amazon’s web store to the shelves at Walmart Inc. and Target Corp.\n\n“Amazon is building a massive economy comparable to the gross domestic product of entire countries,” says Branded’s Ronen. “I mostly see an opportunity to partner with them. Our interests are aligned.”\n\nFor Amazon merchants who can’t afford to expand or are simply burned out, the swarm of aggregators offer a viable exit strategy. Tony and Carol Meibock, a husband and wife team from Calgary, Canada, carved out a niche selling soaps and foot soaks made from peppermint and tea tree oil to treat dry skin, jock itch and athlete’s foot. With annual sales in the millions of dollars and their company, Truremedy Naturals, turning a profit, Tony quit his software job to help run the business.\n\nThen demand surged during the pandemic, and the couple found themselves working nonstop to resolve one supply-chain headache after another. To keep growing required hiring more people, which would have hurt profits and made the company worth less to a buyer. Tony Meibock, 54, had already made connections with potential acquirers in the tight-knit community of online merchants, so it wasn’t hard to spread word that he was interested in selling. His phone and his email inbox blew up.\n\nNot that it was easy letting go of a business they’d built. “My wife was attached to it. It was her baby. But we also realized we needed a break,” he says. “Of course we wanted to make some money, but we cared about the brand and wanted to leave it in good hands.”\n\nHe spoke with about five interested parties last summer and sold to Perch in January for undisclosed terms. Carol is enjoying time with the grandkids; Tony will try advising other firms that sell on Amazon. Ski trips are on the agenda.\n\nPerch was founded by Chris Bell, a Boston entrepreneur who learned how to value businesses while working in mergers and acquisitions at Bain & Co. Later, he got e-commerce experience running Wayfair Inc.’s delivery operations. Bell attended a New York conference for Amazon sellers in 2019 and was surprised to encounter big crowds at a session on how to sell your business. The attendees had the same manufacturing and shipping problems he had learned to solve, and Bell got interested in rolling up sellers.\n\nHe half hoped friends would talk him out of it. Instead, a pal pulled up the Amazon website, searched for faucets and marveled that obscure brands dominated the results. Kohler Co., a mainstay at home-improvement chains, was nowhere to be found.\n\n“All of these big brands with all of these advertising dollars don’t dominate Amazon,” Bell says. “It's just a different playing field. The winners are these small guys who don’t have enough capital to expand into Europe.”\n\nHe went out on his own and connected with Alex Finkelstein at Spark Capital. An early Wayfair investor who watched the furniture and housewares store prosper despite Amazon, Finkelstein knew there was room for many companies to do well online. “I view Amazon as a partner and not a competitor,” he says.\n\nOnce an aggregator buys a business, typical first steps include finding more inventory to expand into Europe and Australia. Bigger factory orders help them negotiate better prices with manufacturers, materials suppliers and shippers. Sometimes small changes go a long way. Perch squeezed silicon straws into smaller packages and shaved 5% off Amazon’s shipping fees. And sometimes it’s a matter of deploying data scientists to determine how much to spend on advertising and search terms to maximize sales and profits.\n\nIt’s not always smooth. Amazon suspended a maternity belt brand from the site three weeks after Perch purchased it. For reasons that remain unclear, Amazon suspected the products were counterfeit and halted all sales for two months, costing the aggregator about $500,000 in sales. “No one got much sleep,” Bell says. Finally, Amazon turned the spigot back on. Aggregators can take such body blows since their sales are spread over more brands, he says. “Now we know where the landmines are.”\n\nThrasio is already a relatively big business. The aggregator has rolled up more than 90 companies that sell more than 15,000 products, mostly on Amazon. The company says it generated more than $100 million in profit on $500 million in sales last year. Co-founder Josh Silberstein says small Amazon businesses tend to see their margins decline as sales grow from $1 million to $10 million because they suddenly need expensive outside help to resolve logistical issues, legal matters and customer service.\n\n“As they get bigger, they get less good at covering all of these different functions,” Silberstein says. Thrasio is set up to handle such challenges for multiple products. It also created a streamlined system to quickly determine the value of an Amazon business so Thrasio can close an acquisition in as little as 35 days, a sweetener for moms and pops looking to get out.\n\nAs more aggregators pour into the market, bidding wars are breaking out, and prices have spiked more than 30% in the past year, according to people involved in deals. So far, acquirers are willing to pay for proven Amazon brands, says Mark Daoust, whose Quiet Light Brokerage closed 70 transactions totaling $110 million in 2020, up 40% from the previous year and expects to close more than 100 deals this year.\n\nIdan Barzilay, 39, a Tel Aviv mechanical engineer who started selling virtual-reality smartphone headsets on Amazon a few years ago, was all set to offload his company last year. Then the buyer backed out when the pandemic hit. No matter. Sales of Barzilay’s headsets took off because homebound parents were desperate to distract their kids—even if it meant more screen time. Soon his company was more valuable than ever, and he sold to Perch for confidential terms.\n\n“The sellers, we are like fish in a lake,” Barzilay says. “There are a lot of fishermen, which means it gets harder and harder for them to catch a nice fish.”\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Text": "TipRanks\n\nInvestors have been fixated on growth companies over the past year, and one segment which has been on the rise is the fledgling cannabis industry. The sector offers a unique proposition and the prospect of further growth, as there is still a major catalyst on the horizon which will completely alter the industry. As expected, a Democrat led senate has been good news for those banking on marijuana reform at the federal level; And it looks like the anticipated changes could happen faster than initially expected. Backed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democratic Senators have stated that they will push for federal-level legalization of marijuana, promising “a unified discussion draft on comprehensive [cannabis] reform” in the first half of this year. The statement feeds expectations that the Democratic Congressional majority will pass – and that President Biden will sign – a bill to legalize marijuana. Investors are also looking at further state-level legalization moves; one key state in this regard is New York. So, the cannabis industry is looking up. There is an expanding network of state legalization regimes, and expectations of a change in federal policy; both are putting upward pressure on cannabis shares. Against this backdrop, we used TipRanks’ database to find two cannabis stocks that have been earmarked as 'Strong Buys' by the analyst consensus. Both have posted impressive year-to-date performances, and stand to rise even more in the year ahead. Village Farms International (VFF) We will start with Village Farms International, a company that has long been involved in the niche agricultural business. The company started out as a farmer, producing high-quality greenhouse vegetables year-round for sale in the North American market. That background fit the company well for a transition to the cannabis industry – Village Farms has experience in greenhouse production and industrial-scale growing. Village Farms’ shares are showing a tremendous growth profile, up 327% in the past 12 months – with a strong spike in recent days. Two important pieces of news precipitated the surge since the end of January. First, the company has fully repaid – ahead of schedule – the $15 million debt it incurred during its November acquisition of the cannabis growing company Pure Sunfarms. And second, Village Farms increased its investment in the Asian cannabinoid company Altum by 50%, to hold a 10% stake in the company. The move increases the international reach of Village Farms, and its ability to increase Altum holdings in the future. The company was able to fund these moves because it had a successful equity sale in January, putting an additional 10.8 million shares on the market, and raising US$135 million in new capital. In addition to its strong capital and expansion positions, Village Farms has been reporting solid financial results. The company saw US$43 million in revenue for 3Q20, a gain of 12.5% year-over-year. EPS came in at 1 cent per share, a turnaround from the US$0.10 loss in the year-ago quarter. Covering Village Farms for Craig-Hallum, 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers writes: “Village Farms has clearly established itself as the leading cannabis producer in Canada with #1 brand share and industry-leading profitability. Canadian cannabis sales in 2020 through October (latest available) were up 128% y/y, and dispensary counts are set to accelerate through 2021, providing a tailwind to VFF revenues.” Turning to the US markets, and VFF’s position in Canada’s larger neighbor, the analyst goes on to add, “With 5.7M SF of greenhouses in TX, the company also has real US optionality, which is finally being appreciated by investors after the GA election. VFF has historically been undervalued compared to less profitable peers, but we expect shares to continue working higher … as the prospect for US reform increases throughout the year.” To this end, Des Lauriers rates VFF a Buy, and his $25 price target suggests the stock has room for ~26% upside in the coming year. (To watch Des Lauriers’ track record, click here) Overall, there are 3 recent reviews on VFF shares, and all are Buys, giving the stock a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating and showing a general agreement on Wall Street about the company’s strengths. Shares are priced at $19.90, and the $24.33 average price target implies an upside of ~23% for the year ahead. (See VFF stock analysis on TipRanks) TerrAscend Corporation (TRSSF) The next cannabis stock we’re looking at, TerrAscend, is another major cannabis producer in both the US, Canada, and Europe. The company is involved in both the medical and recreational sides of the market, and both grows and produces cannabis and markets a range of products through numerous brand names. TerrAscend’s US operations are located in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Utah, and the company looks to expand as more states legalize cannabis. In a strong sign of the cannabis industry’s strength, TRSSF shares are up a sky-high 624% over the past 12 months. Growth has been fueled by expansion of the cultivation operations in California and Pennsylvania, and by the move into the adult-use recreational market in New Jersey. Last month, TerrAscend closed a non-brokered private placement stock sale, putting more than 18 million common shares on the market. The sale price was C$12.35 (US$9.72), and the offering grossed C$224 million (US$176.3 million). The bulk of the proceeds – some 80% of the total – was put up by four large US-based institutional investors. The funds raised will be used to continue expansion of the company’s cultivation operations (TRSSF has plans to expand growing and manufacturing ops in New Jersey), as well as to pursue merger & acquisition activities. TerrAscend’s rapid growth and strong future prospects have attracted attention from top-rated analysts, including 5-star analyst Eric Des Lauriers of Craig-Hallum (stated above). \"TerrAscend is a leading multi-state operator (MSO) in the US cannabis market with top-tier management, assets, and access to deal flow. We have been bullish on the company since initiating coverage last year and are happy to say the TRSSF team has exceeded our expectations, generating rapid increases in margins and operating leverage that have earned them a place solidly in the Top Tier of MSOs,\" Des Lauriers noted. The analyst summed up, \"[With] US$280M+ raised since the elections and federal reform moving quicker than expected, we think TRSSF does deserve a premium to peers.\" In line with his bullish comments, Des Lauriers rates TRSSF shares a Buy, and has a $20 price target that implies a ~31% upside potential for the next 12 months. Once again, we’re looking at a stock with broad agreement from Wall Street’s analysts – the Strong Buy consensus rating is unanimous, based on 7 recent reviews. Shares are selling for $15.30, and their recent appreciation has pushed that price almost up to the $15.43 average price target.

The Wall Street Journal had reported earlier that Zhang had been detained for allegedly sharing personal data collected by WeChat with Sun Lijun, a former vice public security minister that’s being investigated by Beijing.\n\nZhang, who had been identified as a vice president in a November 2018 statement by a local municipal government, has never held a senior position and is not a vice president, the Tencent spokesperson said. Investigators are looking into what type of data Zhang may have shared with Sun and what the government official may have done with the information, the WSJ said.\n\nTencent said earlier this month it fired more than 100 employees on suspicion of graft over a series of probes over the past year and reported more than 40 workers to police. The company’s rare revelation underscores Beijing’s increasingly tough stance on corruption among government cadres and corporate executives.\n\nRead more: Tencent Fires Over 100 Staffers in a Year-Long Graft Probe\n\nChina is also tightening scrutiny over its most powerful tech corporations including Tencent and arch-rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., seeking to rein in their growing power in a plethora of sectors from finance to e-commerce and the sharing economy.\n\nPony Ma, the company’s chairman and co-founder, isn’t under probe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. He has been free to leave China and traveled to Singapore last year, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter.\n\nShares of Tencent, Asia’s most valuable company, fell as much as 1.6% before paring losses in Hong Kong trading.\n\n“It definitely will trigger some profit taking for the stock given it has surged significantly this year,” said Daniel So, a strategist at CMB International Securities Ltd. “Although the case involves corruption which is a sensitive topic, it seems that the impact will not be as deep as Alibaba at this moment as it is linked to an individual rather than the internet business. Investors will still embrace the stock.”\n\nStory continues\n\n(Updates first paragraph with details)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Date": "2021-02-11",
            "Headline": "Where to Invest $5,000 Right Now",
            "Text": "Do you have $5,000 that you can afford to invest right now? One year ago, if you were to invest that much into shares of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), or Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA), you would have made at least $1,000 regardless of which stock you chose. And it's not too late to invest in them today.\n\nThese businesses are still growing, and I think their shares can still generate double-digit returns in 2021. With multiple industries covered, they can even be great investments to hold together to help diversify your portfolio. Here's what these companies are up to and why their stocks are still buys.\n\n1. AbbVie\n\nHealthcare is a reliable sector to invest in because many companies, including AbbVie, sell products that are needs -- not wants -- for millions of people around the world. On Feb. 3, the company released its fourth-quarter results. Net revenue of $13.9 billion for the period ending Dec. 31, 2020, grew 65.9% year over year. The bulk of that growth can be attributed to its acquisition of Botox maker Allergan. But even on a comparative basis and assuming the Allergan transaction closed at the start of 2019 (the actual date was May 8, 2020), the company still generated 6.8% growth. Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.92 were a 32.1% improvement from the prior-year period. AbbVie forecasts that for 2021, that number will come in between $12.32 and $12.52, which will be an improvement of at least 16.7% from the $10.56 adjusted diluted EPS number that it reported for the full year 2020.\n\nWith a portfolio of drugs that now spans immunology, aesthetics, eye care, women's health, and neuroscience, AbbVie has some excellent diversification, making it an ideal stock to hang on to for the long term. And although its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37 looks high when compared to the average stock on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust that trades at 28 times earnings, after factoring in future profits, AbbVie's forward P/E falls to less than nine. It's a cheap healthcare stock that can put that $5,000 to work, paying a dividend that yields 4.8% -- well above the S&P 500 average of around 1.6%. The stock has slightly underperformed the markets over the past year, rising 13% while the index is up over 16%.\n\nWith a modest valuation, a solid mix of products, and more growth on the way, AbbVie gives investors a great way to earn a strong return (through dividends and capital gains) without taking on much risk.\n\n2. FedEx\n\nIn an increasingly online world, a logistics company like FedEx looks to be another great place to invest in right now. Its next earnings report comes out in March, and it could be an exceptional one. Online retail giant Amazon is coming off a spectacular quarter during which not only did its revenue of $125.6 billion beat analyst projections, but its per-share profits were nearly double what Wall Street was expecting.\n\nAnd where there's online shopping, there's going to be a need for a company like FedEx to move products. In its most recent earnings release, on Dec. 17, 2020, FedEx's sales for the period ending Nov. 30, 2020, totaled $20.6 billion and grew by 19.1%. That month, the company also announced it was beginning to ship coronavirus vaccines from both Moderna and Pfizer to the U.S., which will bring even more business for FedEx in the near future.\n\nWhile FedEx won't transport every vaccine, it's just another example of why its upcoming quarters could look particularly strong. With a P/E of 28, it's not at a higher valuation than the average S&P 500 stock, and in the past year, its shares have soared 66%. Whether you're looking at the short term or long term, FedEx is a top growth investment you can add to your portfolio that also pays a modest dividend of around 1%.\n\n3. Alibaba\n\nIf you're worried about the pandemic, investing in Chinese-based Alibaba could be another solid option for your portfolio. The Chinese economy grew 2.3% in 2020, while other countries around the world were struggling to contain the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And the Chinese economy is on pace for a record-breaking quarter to start the year, with one analyst from Absolute Strategy Research expecting growth to be in the neighborhood of 20%.\n\nAlibaba offers a wide variety of products and services. From its Alipay payment platform to cloud computing and online retail, its business is in a great position to benefit from a strong national economy. It doesn't hurt that it is coming off a strong quarter to end the year. On Feb. 2, Alibaba reported $33.9 billion in sales for the period ending Dec. 31, 2020, which was up 37% from the prior-year period. And its annual active consumers over the trailing 12 months totaled 779 million, which was 22 million more than during the period ending Sept. 30, 2020.\n\nThe stock's P/E multiple of around 30 looks cheap when compared to tech giant Alphabet and the 35 times earnings multiple where it currently trades. And while Alibaba doesn't offer a dividend, its 23% returns in the past 12 months could have still generated some great profits for your portfolio. Alibaba makes for a good investment, whether you are looking for a growth stock to add to your portfolio (that isn't trading at an obscene valuation), or just want to diversify your portfolio and draw on gains made outside of the U.S."

            "Headline": "Unusual Options Activity Insight: Alibaba Group Holding",
            "Text": "Shares of Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $269.08.\n\nSentiment: BEARISH\n\nOption Type: TRADE\n\nTrade Type: CALL\n\nExpiration Date: 2021-03-19\n\nStrike Price: $300.00\n\nVolume: 1128\n\nOpen Interest: 25821\n\nThree Signs Of Unusual Options Activity\n\nExtraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it.\n\nThe trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.\n\nContracts that are \"out of the money\" are also indicative of unusual options activity. \"Out of the money\" contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin.\n\nBullish And Bearish Sentiments\n\nOptions are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.\n\nAlthough the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing These Strategies To Trade Options\n\nUnusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.\n\nFor more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alerts\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n© 2021 Benzinga.com.

            "Text": "In this article, we examined billionaire Ken Fisher's top 10 stock picks to see how these stocks performed in 2020 and what the future prospects are. Click to skip ahead and see Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of investing in high growth stocks paid off in 2020 as his 8 out of the top ten positions outperformed the broader market index. Indeed, the majority of his top 25 positions generated better performance than the S&P 500 index in 2020, thanks to investments in information technology, financial services, and consumer discretionary stocks. His investment firm has also been holding positions in fast-growing companies from the healthcare and communications sectors.\n\nIn addition to investing in the fastest-growing companies, the firm also likes to buy depressed stocks that have strong fundamentals. The firm believes in the demand and supply idea when it comes to pricing any stock. Fisher Asset Management, which is employing several teams of research analysts for finding the best investment opportunities, created positions in 118 stocks during the fourth quarter.\n\nIn addition, the firm likes to hold a stake for the long-term to benefit from share price gains and dividends. Billionaire Ken Fisher’s asset management firm added to its 388 existing positions during the fourth quarter.\n\nThe average time held for the top ten stocks stands around 11.6 quarters while the time held for the top 20 stocks averages around 13.65 quarters.\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher sold out 48 stocks during the fourth quarter of 2020 and reduced his positions in 378 stocks. Overall, the firm held a position in 957 stocks, according to the latest 13F filings.\n\nKen Fisher - FISHER ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management\n\nFounded in 1979 and incorporated in 1986, Fisher Asset Management ended the fourth quarter with $133 billion in 13F portfolio market value, up significantly from $114 billion in the previous quarter and $98 billion at the end of fiscal 2019. Ken Fisher is the heart and soul of Fisher Asset Management and currently serving as the executive chairman and co-chief investment officer. He is the son of legendary investor Philip A. Fisher. Ken Fisher is also a columnist and author. He has written several books on finance.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Ken Fisher’s reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 111 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.\n\nLet’s start examining billionaire Ken Fisher’s top ten stock picks to determine returns in 2020 and what are the future prospects of these positions. Its top ten stock holdings account for almost 32% of the overall portfolio.\n\nThe customer relationship software developer Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) is the tenth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. The firm has benefited from its large position because shares of CRM rallied almost 28% in the last twelve months compared to the S&P 500 growth of almost 17%.\n\nAlger Spectra Fund also believes that Salesforce is a good stock to buy and hold for the long-term. Here is what Alger Spectra Fund stated in an investors letter:\n\n“Salesforce.com is a leading software-as-a-service company with turnkey salesforce productivity and customer relationship management applications as well as a cloud-based development environment. Increased spending on technology by corporations digitizing their business models supported the performance of salesforce.com shares. We believe the return on investment (ROI) from deploying salesforce.com technology is compelling because the company’s products make enterprises more productive and profitable while fostering growth. This attractive ROI has resulted in the company’s continuing high unit volume growth.”\n\nPolen Capital also talked about CRM in its Q4 investor letter:\n\n“We discussed Salesforce.com in the third quarter, but the former went from our top contributor last quarter to the largest detractor this quarter. The double-digit share price decline in the quarter seemed mostly driven by investor reaction after Salesforce announced it would acquire Slack, a collaboration software company, for approximately $28 billion, a high purchase price. While the purchase price is higher than we expected, we believe Slack and its functionality fit well strategically with Salesforce’s suite of enterprise software offerings. At a high-level, Slack offers the ability to make both Salesforce’s and other third-party applications work better for their respective customers. In addition, Salesforce’s world-class selling organization and already large customer base should be beneficial for Slack’s subscription revenue growth, which has been more customer-referral based up to this point. It is too early to know if this acquisition will prove to be a smart allocation of investor capital. That said, Slack has a unique value proposition and was growing nicely on a standalone basis. We believe the Salesforce-Slack strategic vision is on point; and although the purchase price is high in absolute dollars, it represents less than 15% of Salesforce’s market capitalization. We maintain an optimistic view of Salesforce’s business, its competitive positioning within enterprise software, and the rationale behind the Slack acquisition. We expect strong, continued earnings and free cash flow growth many years into the future.”\n\n9. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE)\n\nBillionaire Ken Fisher’s strategy of holding a position in Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has also added to its performance in 2020. Shares of Adobe rallied 34% in the last twelve months, thanks to strong demand for its products. It is the ninth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.18% of the overall portfolio.\n\nNelson Roberts Investment Advisors stated in an investor’s letter that Adobe is likely to perform well despite pandemic related challenges. Here is what Nelson Roberts Investment Advisors said:\n\n“We purchased Adobe, the leading provider of content creation software. Adobe is a software company with a recurring revenue stream, which should insulate it from some of the negative effects of the COVID-19 outbreak.”\n\nPolen Capital also talked about ADBE in its Q4 investor letter:\n\n“Adobe has been a strong performer since our initial purchase in early 2016 and has since compounded annually over 40%. This year has been no exception, with the business performing superbly and the stock appreciating by over 50%. CEO Shantanu Narayen stated, “This reality has created new tailwinds for Adobe.” In addition to consistent and recurring double digit revenue growth, its margin expansion has significantly boosted its earnings power. Non-GAAP operating margins have expanded by over 550 bps in the past year. At the same time, we also believe that CEO Narayen deserves more credit for his capital allocation prowess. He has made sound acquisitions that have boosted the value proposition of his company’s products while strengthening the competitive advantages of the business.”\n\n8. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)\n\nShares of Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) surged almost 40% in the last twelve months on the back of increasing demand for digital ads. It is the eighth largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management’s 13F portfolio, accounting for 2.19% of the overall portfolio.\n\nGiverny Capital Asset Management LLC claims that Alphabet needs to be disciplined in its spending. Here is what Giverny Capital Asset Management stated in an investors letter:\n\n“Alphabet is our largest holding. We’re biased, but we’d argue that Alphabet is reasonably priced. It earns significant profit from travel-related searches, which are way down this year. Travel spending figures to roar back at some point, possibly soon. Alphabet also spends extravagant amounts on R&D and capital spending as it finances younger ventures. Those other businesses, which include YouTube, Waymo self-driving cars and cloud computing centers, plus research in artificial intelligence, should eventually generate meaningful returns for shareholders. Or at worst, they will consume less investment over time. If Alphabet simply exercises discipline over investment spending for a few years as travel advertising rebounds and the core search business grows, the resulting free cash flow should generate satisfactory returns for owners.”\n\n7. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM)\n\nThe chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE: TSM) is one of the best performing stock holding of Fisher Asset Management. This is because shares of TSM jumped 135% in the last twelve months. In addition, the firm has also been bagging big dividends from Taiwan Semiconductor. The company offers a dividend yield of 1.31% despite strong share price gains in the last twelve months.\n\nFirst Eagle Investment Management claims that Taiwan Semiconductor is set to expand its market share in the days ahead. Here is what First Eagle Investment Management stated in an investors letter:\n\n“Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) traded higher during the quarter on signs that its total addressable market was poised to expand. Intel announced that it was facing delays in the manufacture of its next-generation chips and may contract out the work to third parties, opening the door for a large-scale chip “foundry” like TSMC to pick up some of the business. Foundries make chips designed and named by other companies; TSMC already produces certain chips for Intel.”\n\n6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA)\n\nDespite concerns over regulatory issues, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) stock price managed to outperform the broader market index. Shares of Alibaba are up 21% in the past twelve months, meaning Fisher Asset Management has benefited from its stake. It is the sixth-largest stock holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 2.43% of the overall portfolio.\n\nPolen Capital Management, a value-driven, concentrated, long-term investment management firm, highlighted few stocks including Alibaba in an investor’s letter. Here is what Polen Capital Management stated:\n\n“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier-one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: No position.

            "Text": "In this article, we present the 15 Richest People in Central and South America. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Richest People in Central and South America.\n\nThe Pareto principle, famously known as the 80-20 rule, sounds extremely relevant when we take a look at the list of richest people in the world. Roughly speaking, a major chunk of wealth and resources are owned by a limited number of individuals, while the rest of the world is barely meeting its ends meet. The recently published World Social Report 2020 by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs says that the top 1% of the world have seen their wealth increase from 1990 through 2015, while the bottom 40% earned less than a quarter of income in all countries surveyed. Most of the billionaires of the world are from the U.S., and icons like Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett get all the attention. But income inequality is worst in the developing nations. Outside the U.S., we have several billionaires like Industria De Diseno Textil Inditex ADR (OTCMKTS: IDEXY)'s Amancio Ortega, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd – ADR (NYSE: BABA)’s Jack Ma, LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, L’Oreal’s Françoise Bettencourt Meyers, SAP SE (NYSE: SAP)’s Hasso Plattner and Kering’s François Pinault.\n\nBut in this article we will focus on Central and South America.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic drastically affected world economies. However, Central and South America suffered the most losses because of already vulnerable economic and healthcare systems. With an overwhelming number of human lives lost, the continent has struggled to stabilize its economy. According to the IMF's World Economic Output, the GDP of Brazil is expected to rebound by 3.6% in 2021, an improvement from its drastic fall by an estimated 10% in 2020. Chile is also expected to make a rebound on its GDP by 5.8% in 2021. In recent years, Colombia has witnessed low productivity growth and trade integration. According to the World Bank, the GDP of Colombia was expected to contract by 7.2%, and stabilize at a rate of 4.2% in 2022. Other countries like Argentina, Peru, Venezuela had varying rates of recession and reduction in economic growth\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother effect of the pandemic on Central and South America is the increase in the unemployment rate. According to data released by the World Bank, Argentina unemployment rate was estimated at 10.4% in 2020. Chile also had a 7.1% unemployment rate. In Brazil, the unemployment rate was recorded at 12%. The 2020 Labor Overview for Latin America and the Caribbean highlighted the severe effects of the the pandemic on the labor force.\n\nBut the coronavirus crisis, like pandemics in the past, has boosted wealth of the rich. According to data from Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list, billionaires in Brazil saw their combined net worth increase by $145 billion in 2020. The combined net worth of the richest people in Chile increased by nearly 27%. Central and South America has always had a wide income inequality, compared with other countries. The COVID-19 pandemic made this worse by increasing the poverty level in these countries. In Argentina, the government increased the tax rate on the income of billionaires in order to handle the effects of the pandemic\n\nIn this article, we will assess the 15 Richest People in Central and South America based on their net worth. We used data from Forbes to properly assess their net worth.\n\n5 Richest People in Central and South America\n\nCopyright: sainaniritu / 123RF Stock Photo\n\n15.

            "Headline": "Masayoshi Son Just Pushed SoftBank Shares Past Dot-Com Peak",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- For Masayoshi Son, these days are even better than the dot-com bubble.\n\nShares in the Japanese billionaire’s SoftBank Group Corp. surged in Tokyo on Tuesday to the highest close since the company went public in 1994, rising past a long-standing record two decades ago.\n\nThe shares rose 4.2% to finish at 10,420 yen, surpassing its previous record of 10,111.09 yen marked on Feb. 18, 2000. SoftBank’s share price increases have been backed by a surging stock market which lifted the value of its portfolio companies.\n\nThe gains come on the heels of last week’s record earnings at its Vision Fund, which reported an $8 billion profit in the three months ended in December. Son has said he wants 10 to 20 of his portfolio companies to go public each year. Already this year, South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang Corp. filed for a U.S. listing, which could more than triple the value of SoftBank’s $3 billion investment.\n\n“The global equity market rally is boosting people’s view on SoftBank’s first and second Vision Funds,” said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center.\n\nIt’s a remarkable turnaround for SoftBank, which just last May posted a record fiscal year operating loss of 1.35 trillion yen ($12.5 billion) after missteps with office-sharing provider WeWork and satellite startup OneWeb. The coronavirus pandemic compounded those challenges, putting in jeopardy Son’s investments in the so-called sharing economy. Shares fell as low as 2,687 yen apiece.\n\nIn a bid to regain investor support, Son reversed his long-standing aversion to parting with equity investments. He pledged in March to sell off 4.5 trillion yen in assets and buy back 2.5 trillion yen of its own stock. He quickly peddled stakes in China e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., T-Mobile US Inc. and SoftBank Corp., the domestic wireless business.\n\nWhile aggressive buybacks propped up SoftBank Group’s shares last year, surging demand for IPOs pushed the stock to new heights. In November, the Vision Fund reported a record profit, largely due to a $5.1 billion gain from its investment in a Chinese real estate startup called KE Holdings Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis month, SoftBank revealed the Vision Fund had made even more money in the December quarter. A rally in technology shares boosted the value of stakes in publicly traded firms like Uber Technologies Inc. and sparked strong demand for IPOs from portfolio companies such as DoorDash Inc. SoftBank invested about $680 million for a stake in DoorDash that is now worth about $9 billion, Son said last week.\n\nThe lofty share price may bring back bubble-era memories, when Son briefly became the world’s richest man from backing hundreds of dot-com startups -- only to see his fortune plunge by $70 billion in a matter of months.\n\nLast week, he revisited his argument that SoftBank is like a goose that lays golden eggs, from Alibaba two decades ago to DoorDash and Coupang now. At one point, he marched in place while an animated goose laid sparkling eggs and music from Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker played.\n\n“Since the Vision Fund launched, the number of golden eggs is in accelerating mode,” he said. “We are finally in the harvesting stage.”\n\nWith Tuesday’s rally, the stock has surpassed Ishino’s target share price of 10,000 yen. The stock also trades above analysts’ 12-month consensus of 9,592.14 yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 14-day relative strength index on SoftBank stock hovers above the 70 mark, an indication that shares may be poised for a downward correction.\n\nRead more: Masayoshi Son Explains the Vision Behind SoftBank’s Vision Fund\n\nIshino said it’s “possible” for SoftBank’s stock to head for levels near 15,000 yen, as Son has asked investors to evaluate the stock based on its net asset value, or the value of its equity holdings less its net debt. SoftBank calculated its net asset value at 14,935 yen a share as of Jan. 1, with much of that coming from Alibaba.\n\n“My eyes are on how the net asset value growth takes its course from here,” Ishino said. “Currently, it relies heavily on Alibaba. The focus will be on whether it is able to lift expectations for its other investments in the two Vision Funds, as it cuts back on Alibaba.”\n\n(Updates to add a chart)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Headline": "Unusual Options Activity Insight: Alibaba Group Holding",
            "Text": "Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved down to $267.83 following the option alert.\n\nSentiment: BULLISH\n\nOption Type: SWEEP\n\nTrade Type: CALL\n\nExpiration Date: 2021-02-26\n\nStrike Price: $280.00\n\nVolume: 1195\n\nOpen Interest: 3274\n\nThree Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual'\n\nOne way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it.\n\nThe trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset.\n\n\"Out of the money\" contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. \"Out of the money\" occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future.\n\nUnderstanding Sentiment\n\nOptions are \"bullish\" when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are \"bearish\" when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.\n\nThese observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nUsing These Options Strategies\n\nUnusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.\n\nFor more information to understand options alerts, visit https://pro.benzinga.help/en/articles/1769505-how-do-i-understand-options-alerts\n\nSee more from Benzinga\n\n© 2021 Benzinga.com.

            "Headline": "Baidu’s Back With an $80 Billion Rally and Electric Car Ambition",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- For two decades, Baidu Inc. has largely been viewed as an online marketing company selling ads within its web search results. Now, the internet company is ready to make the case that it has more to offer.Shares of China’s largest search engine firm have surged nearly threefold since their mid-March lows, when the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic forced marketers and brands to tighten their budgets. Since then, advertising has staged a recovery, while Baidu’s years of investments in artificial intelligence is starting to bear fruit as it monetizes the technology in electric vehicles and smart speakers. The rally has emboldened the 21-year-old company to tap capital markets with a slew of financing plans, including a potential second listing in Hong Kong.Executives unfurling earnings after trading hours on Wednesday will seek to reassure investors that the $80 billion gain in its market value has legs. Revenue for the December quarter is projected to surge 4.1%, the fastest pace in 2020, according to analysts’ estimates.“AI was popular a couple of years ago, however it has been quiet as the application in real world is not easy,” said Tian X Hou, founder of research firm TH Capital, in a note. “Once these applications come out one by one and are monetized in a bigger scale, Baidu is likely to enjoy multiple expansion.”\n\nOnce one of China’s big three tech leaders alongside Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu is playing catch up as the country’s internet users increasingly shift from desktop to mobile. It began to sink billions of dollars into areas from language learning to voice interaction and autonomous driving, betting on smart devices and vehicles of the future. But that endeavor ran into trouble in the initial stages, capped by the departures of several pivotal executives including a well-regarded former chief scientist.Now, aided by years of steady investment in R&D and Beijing’s focus on developing smart nationwide infrastructure, commercialization cases are finally coming to the fore: In January, the company announced it’s teaming up with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to produce smart electric vehicles. The tie-up is intended to help Baidu deploy its Apollo self-driving tech in more vehicles, a person familiar with the matter has said.Baidu’s Apollo and EV business is valued at $32 billion by Daiwa Capital Markets analysts including John Choi, who benchmarked it to the value of Chinese EV peers while forecasting $8.3 billion revenue for the segment in 2023. “Baidu will work to unlock values of its technologies in 2021,” they wrote in January.With its AI applications still in the early stages and technology investments likely to keep compressing margins, Baidu has sought external capital to bankroll its expansion. Last year, the company’s smart speaker division received its first independent financing round at a $2.9 billion value. It has recently reached out to investors including IDG Capital and GGV Capital to raise funds for its AI chips unit ahead of a potential spinoff of the business, according to people with knowledge of the matter.At the same time, Baidu is seeking to raise another $3 billion in its biggest syndicated loan deal, Bloomberg News reported last week, citing people with knowledge of the plan. Those funding efforts precede a Hong Kong share sale that’s said to be on track to raise $3.5 billion. The company has selected CLSA Ltd. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the listing which could take place as soon as the first half of this year, people familiar said in January.The most imminent threat, however, comes from upstarts like TikTok-owner ByteDance Ltd. Newer social platforms like Douyin, the Chinese twin of TikTok, have increasingly gained user traffic at the expense of Baidu offerings including its Netflix-style affiliate iQiyi Inc. Baidu -- which makes about 70% of revenue from online marketing -- controlled 8% of Chinese users’ time spent on apps in December, half of ByteDance’s 16%, according to researcher QuestMobile.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo compete, its flagship search app is morphing into a social media platform hosting an array of content from news articles to live-streams and short videos. In November, the Beijing-based company agreed to buy Joyy Inc.’s YY streaming service for $3.6 billion in a deal that is already been substantially completed.\n\n“Guidance on the ad outlook is likely to be positive as the worst already appears to be behind,” Citi analyst Alicia Yap wrote in a report. “Potential for more news flow related to EV and autonomous driving initiatives in the coming months is likely to support continued positive momentum in the share price heading into an Hong Kong listing.”\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc. plans to list its shipping business in Hong Kong, raising potentially billions of dollars to capitalize on China’s post-Covid e-commerce boom.\n\nJD Logistics Inc.’s initial public offering could raise roughly $5 billion and value the unit at about $40 billion, people familiar with the matter have said. Details of the proposed spinoff haven’t been finalized, the company said in an IPO prospectus filed to the stock exchange.\n\nJD.com’s shares gained more than 6% to a record in Hong Kong Wednesday. The Chinese e-commerce operator joins an IPO rush fueled by flush liquidity in markets worldwide, with Hong Kong in particular emerging as a hot venue for tech coming-out parties. Kuaishou Technology in January completed the biggest internet debut since Uber Technologies Inc.’s, marking the best start to a year for Asian stock listings on record. New Horizon Health Ltd. this week became the second-most popular Hong Kong IPO among retail investors in the city’s history.\n\nJD Logistics should similarly draw interest. Shopping sites from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to Pinduoduo Inc. have benefited as Covid-19 lockdowns drove consumers online and galvanized demand for the services that deliver parcels to doorsteps. Chinese e-commerce revenue should surpass 50% of the country’s total retail sales this year -- a first anywhere in the world, according to researcher EMarketer. BofA Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Haitong International Capital are the joint sponsors of the proposed IPO, according to the prospectus.\n\nRead More: JD’s Logistics Unit Said to Mull IPO at $40 Billion Valuation\n\nJD Logistics’s imminent IPO would be a milestone for its parent, which spent billions of dollars building one of China’s largest courier services to ensure on-time delivery and retain control over its shipping network. That inhouse operation, which spanned more than 800 warehouses across the country as of Sept. 30., has been credited for speeding JD.com’s recovery from early Covid 19 disruptions.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The spinoff and separate listing will help JD.com crystallize the value of its logistics arm, which it had invested in heavily for more than a decade,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “The funds raised can aid JD Logistics’s expansion without burdening JD.com. Going forward investors and management can focus on two distinct businesses, e-commerce and logistics, which have different growth and profitability profiles.”\n\nChinese e-commerce sales have increased several fold during the pandemic, making companies that help handle shipping and deliveries particularly attractive, Elysia Tse, head of Asia Pacific research and strategy at LaSalle Investment Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television this month.\n\nJD Logistics’s net loss narrowed to 11.7 million yuan ($1.8 million) in the nine months ended September from more than 80 times that a year earlier. Losses attributable to the company’s owners also narrowed to 71.2 million yuan from almost a billion yuan a year earlier. And revenue growth accelerated 43.2% to 49.5 billion yuan during the period, according to its filing.\n\nThe continuing boom in Asian listings follows on from the trend seen last year globally, where investors piled into offerings in search for returns, sending company valuations soaring on their debuts. Listings globally have had a record-breaking start to the year thanks to a surge in SPAC listings, equities hitting fresh highs and hordes of retail traders flocking to markets.\n\nThe IPO will “lead to a re-rating for a pretty substantial part of JD’s business, which in turn should be good for JD’s shares,” said Robin Zhu, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research in Hong Kong. “More upside is likely as we get more color that enables us to value JD Logistics properly.”\n\n(Updates with share action and analyst’s comments from the third paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Headline": "Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs In The World",
            "Text": "In this article, we are going to list the Top 15 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World. Click to skip ahead and jump to the Top 5 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World.\n\nSerial entrepreneurs start new companies, make them successful, and sell them to move on to their next startup. Serial entrepreneurship is on the rise in the U.S. Success stories of figures like Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, Square founder Jim McKelvey, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Gumroad’s Sahil Lavingia, 23andMe’s Anne Wojcicki and several others are fueling inspiration across the country among young people to launch startups. Data from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association suggest that venture capitalists invested a whopping $156.2 billion into domestic startups in 2020 alone.\n\nSerial Entrepreneurship is a Tough Game\n\nBut starting and selling companies is not for everyone. Data from TechCrunch suggests that the chances of a startup being acquired at or after Series C are very small. To give you some context, making it to Series C is extremely difficult. TechCrunch’s report said that out of every 1,000 startups that successfully close a Pre-Series A funding round, only 400 make it to Series A.\n\nSuccessful founders and venture capitalists are also helping startups grow and reach their goals. For example Jim McKelvey launched a startup accelerator SixThirty, which will back four financial-services startups each fall and spring and invest $100,000 a year.\n\nEntrepreneurs who risk starting up a venture are rewarded with profits and growth opportunities if their idea becomes successful. But if their calculations and applications were not properly assessed, they could suffer great losses. A serial entrepreneur, on the other hand, takes risks repeatedly. A serial entrepreneur analyzes real problems and identifies the solutions for which a large number of customers are willing to pay.\n\nTop 15 Serial Entrepreneurs in the World\n\nUnlike a traditional entrepreneur who prefers to build a company and stick with it until the end, a serial entrepreneur does not stop at a single venture. Steve Jobs is one of the perfect examples of the top serial entrepreneurs in the world. In 1976, college dropouts Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple Computers Inc in a garage. In December 1980, Apple launched its initial public offering selling 4.6 million shares at $22 per share. It was a massive hit by the end of the day, as the stock had increased in value by approximately 32%, leaving the company with a market value of $1.778 billion. Today, Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) trades at $135.37 per share with a market cap of over $2 trillion. In 1985 Steve Jobs created NeXT, an operating system and business computer company which later on benefited the operating systems of Apple computers. In 1997, Apple bought NeXT for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock. In 1986, the serial tech entrepreneur acquired the gold standard of the animated filmmaker, Pixar, for $5 million. In 2006, Jobs sold Pixar to Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) for over $7 billion. Today, Pixar Animated Studios is acknowledged as one of the world's most influential film studios.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Antifragility of Serial Entrepreneurs\n\nWhile chasing for success has always been the goal for many business founders, serial entrepreneurs are anti-fragile: they gain from failure. Studies show serial entrepreneurs have greater success than first-timers. As to the obvious reason, serial entrepreneurs have more experience in managing a business as it is natural for them to look for different ventures they could invest in. According to a Harvard Business School paper about \"Performance Persistence in Entrepreneurship\", serial entrepreneurs are more likely to succeed than first-time entrepreneurs or those who have failed in part because serial entrepreneurs \"exhibit persistence in selecting the right industry and time to start new ventures\".\n\nThrough the years, serial entrepreneurs have been perfecting their skills in building successful ventures. Another research to back it up was performed by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in which they observed thousands of startups over 25 years. The purpose of the study entitled \"Skill vs. Luck in Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital\" was precisely to understand whether the success of serial entrepreneurs stems from the skills they have perfected in their careers or from external factors. The study found that \"successful serial entrepreneurs are more likely to replicate the success of their past companies\" and that \"skills are an important determinant of success for entrepreneurial start-ups\". The study also highlighted the key distinction between previously successful founders and formerly unsuccessful entrepreneurs: \"Entrepreneurs who have been successful in previous business are much more likely to succeed in current business than first-time entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs who have previously failed.\"\n\n12 most influential Chinese entrepreneurs\n\nMatej Kastelic/Shutterstock.com\n\nAll evidence seems to point to the fact that one of the main skills of the top serial entrepreneurs in the world is to learn from their successes and failures to achieve more with their next venture.\n\nWe identified the top serial entrepreneurs in the world by screening Forbes' Real-Time Billionaire list. Thus you will encounter some of the entrepreneurs on our list from the 25 Highest Earning Billionaires in 2020. To give you the most accurate ranking, we identified these high-profile serial entrepreneurs in the world not only by their net worth but also by the companies that they ventured in.\n\nLet's start our list of top 15 serial entrepreneurs in the world.\n\n15. Gautam Adani\n\nNet worth (in 2021): $32.2billion\n\nCountry: India\n\nOne of the most successful top serial entrepreneurs in the world is ports tycoon, Gautam Adani. Adani Enterprises Ltd (NSE: ADANIENT) operates in different industries such as power generation, real estate, edible oil, and defense. The Indian multi-billionaire also manages Mundra Port in Gujarat and Abbot Point in Australia.

            "Headline": "Baidu’s Stronger-Than-Expected Outlook Validates AI Push",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Baidu Inc. forecast sales that topped estimates as efforts by China’s internet search leader to diversify into the cloud and artificial intelligence businesses start to pay off.\n\nRevenue for the period ending in March will be 26 billion yuan ($4 billion) to 28.5 billion yuan, compared with the 25.9 billion yuan average estimate of analysts. Sales last quarter rose 4.8%, the fastest pace in 2020, fueled by a 52% increase in its non-advertising businesses like AI cloud.\n\nOnce one of China’s big three technology titans alongside Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu is playing catch up as the country’s internet users increasingly shift from desktop to mobile. With up-and-coming rivals like TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. taking a larger share of China’s online advertising market, the company is instead repositioning itself as an AI tech provider with mature use cases.\n\n“Our long-term commitment in technology research has made Baidu a leading AI ecology company,” founder Robin Li said after the earnings report, according to an internal memo viewed by Bloomberg News. He said Baidu’s core R&D investment was equivalent to around a fifth of its 2020 revenue.\n\nShares of Baidu have surged nearly threefold from their March lows as China’s rebound from the pandemic drove ad spending and the company took steps to monetize its suite of AI technologies. The stock gained more than 3% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe internet giant has over the years sunk billions of dollars into areas from language learning to voice interaction and autonomous driving, betting on smart devices and vehicles of the future. Now, aided by years of investment and Beijing’s bid to build smart nationwide infrastructure, these efforts are finally paying off. In January, the company announced it’s teaming up with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group to produce smart electric vehicles, prompting analysts to hike their value estimates for Baidu’s self-driving unit Apollo.\n\nStory continues\n\nExecutives told analysts on a call Thursday that Baidu’s Apollo-powered software will help differentiate its EV from rivals. The venture with Geely already has a chief executive officer on board and has picked the brand of the vehicle, which will take three years to deliver, Li said.“For EV, AI, they are not stories anymore,” said Tian X Hou, founder of research firm TH Capital. “They are real and have already started to monetize.”With its AI applications still in the early stages and R&D investments likely to keep compressing margins, Baidu has sought external capital to bankroll its expansion. Last year, the company’s smart speaker division received its first independent financing round at a $2.9 billion value. It has recently reached out to investors including IDG Capital and GGV Capital to raise funds for its AI chips unit ahead of a potential spinoff of the business, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nAt the same time, Baidu is seeking to raise another $3 billion in its biggest syndicated loan deal, Bloomberg News reported last week. Those funding efforts precede a Hong Kong share sale that’s said to be on track to raise $3.5 billion.\n\nRevenue from Baidu’s Netflix-style platform iQiyi Inc. fell 0.5% in the period ended December, a second consecutive quarter of declines as Chinese internet users shifted to other social media services like ByteDance’s Douyin. Sales this quarter may drop as much as 8%, the company said.\n\nBaidu apps accounted for 8% of Chinese users’ time spent in December, half that of ByteDance’s 16% share, according to researcher QuestMobile. To compete, its flagship search app is morphing into an all-encompassing social platform not unlike Tencent’s WeChat, and the company is close to completing its $3.6 billion acquisition of Joyy Inc.’s YY live-streaming network.\n\n“We should be concerned that online marketing growth remains weak, because this is Baidu’s most profitable revenue stream,” said Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling. “Non-marketing businesses like hardware and cloud may drive sales growth but will do little for profits. The same is true for newer initiatives like electric vehicles.”\n\n(Updates with comments on EV venture in seventh paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Headline": "Daniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter",
            "Text": "- By Sydnee Gatewood\n\n\n\n\n\nThird Point leader Daniel Loeb (Trades, Portfolio) released his fourth-quarter 2020 portfolio earlier this week.\n\nUsing an event-driven, value-oriented approach to picking stocks, the guru's New York-based firm is known for taking activist positions in underperforming companies that have a catalyst that will help unlock value for shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping these criteria in mind, Loeb entered 35 new positions during the quarter, divested of nine holdings and added to or trimmed a number of other existing investments. Notable trades for the three months ended Dec. 31 included new holdings in Upstart Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UPST) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the sale of Fortive Corp. (NYSE:FTV), a reduction in Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:BABA) and a boost to the Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stake.\n\nUpstart Holdings\n\nIn his largest trade of the quarter, Loeb invested in 13.3 billion shares of Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ:UPST), dedicating 4.01% of the equity portfolio to the stake. It is now the guru's fifth-largest holding. The stock traded for an average price of $40.75 per share during the quarter.\n\nThe San Carlos, California-based company, which operates an online lending platform, has a $6 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $83.35 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 1,655.09 and a price-sales ratio of 36.12.\n\nSince its initial public offering in December, the stock has gained more than 150%.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nGuruFocus rated Upstart's financial strength 3 out of 10.\n\nIn his fourth-quarter letter to investors, Loeb said the company \"exemplifies Third Point's approach to lifecycle investing.\"\n\n\"Following a lead from our Structured Credit group, which had looked at funding Upstart's loan pools, we led Upstart's Series C in June of 2015 and Rob Schwartz joined their Board,\" he wrote. \"Third Point delivered value on capital markets strategy, staffing, and organizational development, and eventually became a loan buyer on the platform. As Upstart grew, we maintained our ownership through further investments and placed a 10% order of the IPO in December 2020.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOf the gurus invested in Upstart, Loeb by far has the largest stake with 18.47% of outstanding shares. George Soros (Trades, Portfolio) and Paul Tudor Jones (Trades, Portfolio) also own the stock.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe guru picked up 260,000 Class C shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), allocating 3.51% of the equity portfolio to the position. Shares traded for an average price of $1,685.58 each during the quarter.\n\nHe previously sold out of the stock in the second quarter of 2018. It is now the eighth-largest holding in the equity portfolio.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nThe tech conglomerate headquartered in Mountain View, California, which owns Google, YouTube and a number of other businesses, has a market cap of $1.42 trillion; its shares were trading around $2,102.22 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 35.78, a price-book ratio of 6.88 and a price-sales ratio of 8.44.\n\nThe Peter Lynch chart shows the stock is trading above its fair value, suggesting it is overpriced. The GuruFocus valuation rank of 3 out of 10 supports this assessment since the share price and price ratios are approaching 10-year highs.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nAlphabet's financial strength was rated 8 out of 10 by GuruFocus on the back of adequate interest coverage and a robust Altman Z-Score of 11.07. Although assets are building up at a faster rate than revenue is growing, indicating it may be becoming less efficient, the return on invested capital eclipses the weighted average cost of capital. This means it is creating value.\n\nThe company's profitability scored a 9 out of 10 rating, driven by strong margins and returns that outperform a majority of competitors. Alphabet also has a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 4, indicating its operations are stable, and consistent earnings and revenue growth contributed to a predictability rank of five out of five stars. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return an average of 12.1% annually over a 10-year period.\n\nWith 0.25% of outstanding shares, Ken Fisher (Trades, Portfolio) is Alphabet's largest guru shareholder. Other top guru investors include PRIMECAP Management (Trades, Portfolio), Pioneer Investments (Trades, Portfolio), Andreas Halvorsen (Trades, Portfolio), Frank Sands (Trades, Portfolio), Spiros Segalas (Trades, Portfolio), Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio), Bill Nygren (Trades, Portfolio) and Chris Davis (Trades, Portfolio).\n\nFortive\n\nAfter establishing a 3 million-share stake in Fortive (NYSE:FTV) during the third quarter, the investor divested of his entire holding, impacting the equity portfolio by -1.95%. The stock traded for an average per-share price of $68.32 during the quarter.\n\nGuruFocus estimates Loeb gained 17.06% on the investment.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nThe Everett, Washington-based company, which focuses on industrial growth through innovation in the areas of field instrumentation, transportation, sensing, product realization, automation and specialty as well as franchise distribution, has a $22.35 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $66.16 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 15.11, a price-book ratio of 2.67 and a price-sales ratio of 3.5.\n\nAccording to the Peter Lynch chart, the stock is trading near its fair value.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nGuruFocus rated Fortive's financial strength 6 out of 10 on the back of adequate interest coverage and a high Altman Z-Score of 3.34. The WACC, however, eclipses the ROIC, indicating issues with creating value.\n\nThe company's profitability also fared well with a 7 out of 10 rating. Although the operating margin is in decline, Fortive has strong returns that outperform a majority of industry peers and a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 6. Revenue per share had been in decline for the past five years, however.\n\nAndreas Halvorsen (Trades, Portfolio) is the company's largest guru shareholder with a 2.36% stake. Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Renaissance Technologies, Pioneer, Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio), Jones, Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio), Wallace Weitz (Trades, Portfolio), Jeremy Grantham (Trades, Portfolio), Lee Ainslie (Trades, Portfolio) and Murray Stahl (Trades, Portfolio) also have positions in the stock.\n\nAlibaba\n\nLoeb curbed his stake in Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) by 44.55%, selling 1.13 million shares. The transaction had an impact of -3.32% on the equity portfolio. The stock traded for an average price of $277.43 per share during the quarter.\n\nHe now holds 1.4 million shares total, which account for 2.51% of the equity portfolio. GuruFocus estimates he has gained 10.79% on the investment.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce company has a market cap of $716.48 billion; its shares were trading around $263.95 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 30.82, a price-book ratio of 5.08 and a price-sales ratio of 7.67.\n\nBased on the Peter Lynch chart, the stock appears to be overvalued.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nDriven by a good cash-debt ratio, a comfortable level of interest coverage and a robust Altman Z-Score of 6.51, GuruFocus rated Alibaba's financial strength 7 out of 10.\n\nThe company's profitability scored a 9 out of 10 rating. Although the operating margin is in decline, Alibaba has strong returns that outperform a majority of competitors as well as a high Piotroski F-Score of 4. Despite recording consistent earnings and revenue growth, the 2.5-star predictability rank is on watch. GuruFocus says companies with this rank typically return an average of 7.3% annually.\n\nOf the gurus invested in Alibaba, Fisher has the largest stake with 0.52% of outstanding shares. Additional top guru shareholders are PRIMECAP, Sands, Pioneer, Chase Coleman (Trades, Portfolio), Davis, Dodge & Cox, Sarah Ketterer (Trades, Portfolio), Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio) and David Tepper (Trades, Portfolio), among others.\n\nIntuit\n\nBoosting his Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) holding by 233.33%, Loeb purchased 700,000 shares. The transaction had an impact of 2.05% on the equity portfolio. During the quarter, shares traded for an average price of $351.49 each.\n\nThe guru now holds 1 million shares total, representing 2.93% of the equity portfolio and is his 10th-largest holding. GuruFocus data shows he has gained 24.8% on the investment so far.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nThe Mountain View, California-based software company has a $113.27 billion market cap; its shares were trading around $413.02 on Thursday with a price-earnings ratio of 55.47, a price-book ratio of 20.88 and a price-sales ratio of 13.93.\n\nThe Peter Lynch chart indicates the stock is overvalued. The GuruFocus valuation rank of 1 out of 10 aligns with this assessment since the price-sales ratio and share price are both approaching 10-year highs.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nIntuit's financial strength was rated 7 out of 10 by GuruFocus on the back of a comfortable level of interest coverage as well as a robust Altman Z-Score of 19.08. The ROIC also surpasses the WACC, indicating good value creation.\n\nThe company's profitability scored an 8 out of 10 rating, driven by an expanding operating margin, returns that outperform a majority of industry peers and a moderate Piotroski F-Score of 5. Steady earnings and revenue growth also resulted in a two-star predictability rank. According to GuruFocus, companies with this rank return, on average, 6% annually.\n\nWith a 1.85% stake, Sands is Inuit's largest guru shareholder. PRIMECAP, Pioneer, Coleman, Catherine Wood (Trades, Portfolio), Cohen, Louis Moore Bacon (Trades, Portfolio) and Grantham also have significant positions in the stock.\n\nAdditional trades and portfolio performance\n\nOther new positions Loeb established during the quarter included Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV), Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

(KMX) and RH (RH).\n\nThe guru's $12.97 billion equity portfolio, which is composed of 74 stocks, is most heavily invested in the consumer cyclical (22.39%) and communication services (18.27%) sectors.\n\nDaniel Loeb's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\nIn his fourth-quarter letter, Loeb said the Third Point Offshore Fund posted a 20.5% return for full-year 2020, outperforming the S&P 500's 18.4% return.\n\nDisclosure: No positions.\n\nRead more here:\n\nDavid Einhorn's Top 4 Buys of the 4th Quarter\n\n4 Stocks to Fall in Love With on Valentine's Day\n\nAkre Capital's Top Trades of the 4th Quarter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot a Premium Member of GuruFocus?

            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Webull, the Chinese-owned brokerage that runs one of the fastest-growing retail trading platforms in the U.S., raised $150 million in a new financing round that gives the startup more firepower to compete with Robinhood Markets.\n\nThe fundraising valued Webull’s parent company at more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. A Webull spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe brokerage, founded by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. alum Wang Anquan, has benefited from the surge in trading by individual investors as stock prices soar to all-time highs. Webull has positioned itself as the go-to platform for disgruntled users of Robinhood, whose restrictions last month on highly volatile stocks including GameStop Corp. sparked outrage from some customers and drew criticism from politicians.\n\nRobinhood CEO Vlad Tenev, who has defended his firm’s decisions as necessary to meet clearing demands, is among those scheduled to appear at a congressional hearing about the GameStop saga on Thursday.\n\nLike Robinhood, Webull offers free stock trades with a slick online interface. The Chinese-owned firm has tried to differentiate itself with more sophisticated investment tools and more responsive customer service.\n\nAt the end of 2020, Webull said it was receiving an average of about 850 transfers from other U.S. brokerage accounts every day, roughly half of which it estimated came from Robinhood. In late January, as Robinhood came under fire for restricting trades in GameStop, Webull said new account signups were 1,548% higher than the seven-day average.\n\nWang, who left Alibaba to help run the finance unit at Chinese tech giant Xiaomi Corp. before striking out on his own, founded Webull’s parent company, Fumi Technology, in 2016. He owned a stake of about 35% as of December, according to Chinese corporate registration records. Funds affiliated with Xiaomi owned at least 14%, while a unit of Chinese wealth manager Noah Holdings Ltd. owned about 9%. It’s unclear which investors participated in the latest funding round.\n\nStory continues\n\nWebull is overseen from New York by Anthony Denier, the firm’s chief executive officer. He said in an interview late last year that Webull was planning to raise more than $100 million in a funding round that would “bring in very big, well-known U.S. investors” and give the firm “unicorn status.”\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Text": "Benzinga\n\nWarren Buffett in his annual letter to shareholders offered words of encouragement to a battered country while also signaling that more stock buybacks are to come. Buffett's Annual Letter: The letter from the 90-year-old chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) was even more anticipated than usual this year, because his influential voice has largely been silent since his last letter, which came in the very early days of the pandemic. A lot has happened since, from the contentious election and ensuing fallout, to the arrival of retailer investors pushing \"stonks,\" not to mention the meteoric rise of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). Buffett's lieutenant, Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, spoke on Wednesday about some of these issues. He said the trading in stocks such as GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) was tantamount to \"betting on racehorses\" and cast doubt on the idea that Bitcoin will ever replace regular money as the world's primary medium of exchange. Buffett in his letter did not talk about cryptocurrency or GameStop, but he did touch on the turmoil of the past year, without directly referencing any particular event. He used the stories of companies throughout the country that he has invested in, such as GEICO and Pilot Travel Centers, to deliver a simple, clear message: \"Never bet against America.\" (Italics in original.) \"There has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country’s economic progress has been breathtaking,\" he wrote. \"Beyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming 'a more perfect union.' Progress on that front has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so.\" Earnings, Stock Repurchases: As for the latest numbers on the company's performance, the letter showed Berkshire earned $42.5 billion last year, down 48% from 2019's $81.4 billion. This included an $11 billion loss from a write-down in subsidiary and affiliate businesses, particularly the 2016 purchase of Portland, Oregon-based metal fabricator Precision Castparts. The company does business in the aerospace industry — not the best one to be in last year. In his letter, Buffett said he overpaid for the company and that last year's \"adverse developments\" in the industry made that clear. \"I was simply too optimistic about PCC’s normalized profit potential,\" Buffett wrote. The company spent $24.7 billion to repurchase the equivalent of 80,998 \"A\" shares last year, including $9 billion in the fourth quarter. That is likely to continue: \"Berkshire has repurchased more shares since year-end and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,\" Buffett wrote. Berkshire also as usual listed its top holdings by market value. They included Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC). Filings from Berkshire earlier this month showed the company trimmed its positions in Apple while piling into drug, telecom and oil companies in the latest quarter. Recent Price Action: Berkshire's class B shares ended Friday at $240.51, down for the week at 0.54%. Class A shares were down 0.88% to $364,580. Photo Courtesy Wikimedia Commons.

E-commerce giant JD.com Inc. and online gaming firm NetEase Inc. are among the companies that raised some $17 billion in 2020, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The listings act as a hedge against the risk of being kicked off U.S. exchanges as well as giving the companies a broader investor base closer to their home markets.\n\nOther companies planning so-called homecoming listings this year include music-streaming service Tencent Music Entertainment Group, search engine giant Baidu Inc. and online car-trading platform Autohome Inc.

            "Text": "- By Margaret Moran\n\n\n\n\n\nTweedy Browne (Trades, Portfolio) recently disclosed its portfolio updates for the fourth quarter of 2020, which ended on Dec. 31.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firm was established in 1920 by Forest Birchard Tweedy as a dealer in closely held and inactively traded securities. Over its 100-year history, it has evolved into an investing company that seeks long-term capital growth in companies around the globe. Its Benjamin Graham-style value investing approach focuses on investing in undervalued securities that have strong growth potential, above-average dividend yields and established dividend history.\n\nBased on the above criteria, the firm's top buys for the quarter were Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

The three-year revenue growth rate is 45% and the three-year Ebitda growth rate is 38.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nTweedy Browne's Top 4th-Quarter Trades\n\nBank of America\n\nThe firm added 1,345,167 shares, or 218.03%, to its Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) investment for a total holding of 1,962,127 shares. The trade had a 1.27% impact on the equity portfolio.

            "Headline": "PayPal (PYPL) Goes After 'Crypto-Curious' Customers",
            "Text": "PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s (PYPL) interest in cryptocurrency is not new, but over the past quarter the company has taken the plunge, introducing a range of new services and offerings for its customers. The digital payments company is looking to expand further in the first half of this year.\n\nBack in October, the company first allowed its U.S. users to trade cryptocurrencies on its platform. Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin are the cryptocurrencies currently available through PayPal, according to its presentation to investors.\n\nIn the first half of 2021, PayPal will enable users to trade crypto in the U.K. and a number of additional international markets. It will also expand crypto offerings to Venmo, a payment app it bought in 2014. Earlier this month, PayPal announced that it has also established a crypto-focused business unit and is planning to allow users to make purchases through the app using cryptocurrency later this year.\n\n\"I would describe the type of user on our platform right now as more of the crypto-curious,\" said PayPal CFO John Rainey on the fourth quarter analyst call earlier this month. \"We're not getting these heavy day traders in crypto – it's more a casual customer that is somewhat intrigued by this and now has a trusted digital platform where they can go out and buy this and hold this, and then eventually be able to use this as a form of payment.\" Rainey noted that PayPal has also set volume limits on its platform.\n\nPayPal's rollout of crypto offerings is in line with its mission to become a one-stop shop, a closer competitor to a company like Alibaba Group Holding Limited's (BABA) AliPay in China offering a range of services. \"That's really the promise of a super-app, where you can live a lot of your digital life on one app and then be able to manage all of your transactions in one place, track them all, and have personalized, customized recommendations,\" CEO Dan Schulman told MarketWatch. Last quarter, PayPal also made investments in TaxBit, cryptocurrency tax software, and Paxos, a blockchain platform that PayPal uses to provide crypto services.\n\nPayPal's cryptocurrency expansion along with other market players like Visa Inc. (V) are likely to create the so-called network effect and faster adoption rates. \"We are eager to work with central banks and regulators around the world to offer our support, and to meaningfully contribute to shaping the role that digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce,\" Schulman said.\n\nWhile companies like Square, Inc. (SQ) enabled Bitcoin trading years ago, PayPal's expansion has been more gradual. Now this expansion of services coincides with growth in consumer awareness and interest in crypto. The users who buy crypto on PayPal log back into the app at double the rate before purchasing cryptocurrency, the company said.\n\n\"One of the things that I particularly am most excited about is what we're seeing around the levels of engagement of these users,\" Rainey said. \"This really fits with this thesis that we have around, as we add additional products and services that are attractive to our consumer base, it creates a stickiness to our platform where we really are going towards this everyday financial app, and we're quite excited about that.\"\n\nFor PayPal, it's still early days, but it may change as users are able to use cryptocurrencies to make purchases and crypto trading is available in more markets. Customers will be able to use crypto to pay for goods at 29 million merchant locations by the end of the first quarter, the company said.\n\n\"For us to see an outsized impact on our business certainly to the point where it's starting to move the dial on the overall growth numbers of our business we are a little bit of a ways out on that right now,\" Rainey told analysts. \"When we allow our customers to use crypto to go shop at our merchants, our network of [nearly] 30 million merchants around the world, that's where this halo effect or indirect benefit, that's where it gets really attractive on a margin basis, because the funding cost of that being so low.\""

            "Text": "In this article we are going to share our list of the 15 best stocks to buy now for beginner investors. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now For Beginner Investors.\n\nYou can't become a top quarterback by watching and imitating Tom Brady. You can't dunk a basketball the same way Michael Jordan did by watching and imitating Michael Jordan's old games. Investing isn't like professional sports. Even beginner investors can invest like seasoned professional money managers simply by imitating the best fund managers' stock picks.\n\nInsider Monkey has long been a believer of imitating the top stock picks of hedge funds, and this strategy has helped us beat the market consistently over the last several years. Some experts, including billionaire Warren Buffett, gave beginner investors a decent advice: just buy an S&P 500 Index fund and stay invested no matter what happens. This is a decent advice because beginner investors will benefit from the rising markets over the long-term and generate the average return of an average investors. We have a better investment strategy. If you imitate the average stock picks of an average investor, you will definitely generate average returns. If you imitate the best stock picks of the best fund managers, then you are likely to generate much better returns.\n\nAlmost all best fund managers are rich and they manage large sums of money for others. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires money managers who invest at least $100 million in U.S. stocks and some other financial instruments to disclose their holdings to the public once a quarter. This means we get to see what these professional money managers invest in and this also gives us the opportunity to imitate their stock picks. One alternative is to identify a legendary investor, like Warren Buffett, who doesn't make a lot of changes to his/her portfolio and imitate those stock picks. The other alternative is to invest in the stocks that all of these professional money managers agree on.\n\nStory continues\n\nBest Stocks To Buy Now For Beginner Investors\n\nWarren Buffett\n\nWe have been sharing the list of 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds here at Insider Monkey since the end of 2018. Three months ago we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks at the end of September 2020. Three months before that we shared hedge funds’ top 30 stock picks for Q2’20. These top 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 81.2% in 2019 and 2020. Guess what an average investor investing in average S&P 500 Index fund generated during the last 2 years? Only 55.3%. Warren Buffett wasn't wrong about index funds. Fifty five percent return in 2 years isn't too shabby for a beginner investor. However, eighty one percent gain is even better. This quarter's top 30 stocks returned 9.5% so far in 2021 and outperformed the S&P 500 Index's 4.5% gain by 5 percentage points.\n\nSince hedge funds top consensus stock picks have been outperforming the market by large margins, we consider them as the \"best stocks to buy for beginner investors\". Most of these stocks are well-known blue chip companies with relatively low risk. We aren't going to ask you to invest in the top 30 stocks. You can get enough diversification by investing in the top 10 or top 15 hedge fund stocks.\n\nOverall, hedge funds’ top 10 stock picks returned 256.6% between 2014 and 2020. S&P 500 ETF (SPY) returned 132.4% during the same 7 year period. If you invested $10000 in hedge funds' top 10 stock picks at the beginning of 2014, your portfolio would have grown to more than $35000 by the end of 2020. If you had invested in the average stock picks of average investors, your portfolio would have grown to only $23000. That's the difference.\n\nMore than half of all investors invest in dumb index funds because they were made to believe that they can’t outperform the market by stock selection (or they are forced to invest in index funds in their companies’ retirement accounts). We call index fund investing “dumb” because we have been generating much higher returns by investing in hedge funds' consensus stock picks.\n\nIn this article we will share hedge funds’ top 15 stock picks. These stocks returned 98.8% cumulatively in 2019 and 2020.\n\nEvery quarter we process more than 800 hedge funds’ 13F filing and identify the top stocks among ALL 800+ hedge funds. The list of top 15 hedge fund stocks don't change much from quarter to quarter. Insider Monkey’s mission is to identify promising (and also terrible) hedge fund stock pitches and share them with our subscribers. We launched our monthly newsletter’s activist strategy nearly 4 years ago and this strategy’s picks returned 187.5% since then and beat the SPY by 111 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nThe best thing about following hedge funds’ top picks on our website is that you don’t need to pay hedge funds an annual 2% fee and 20% of your profits to beat the market. We do that here free of charge using the holdings data from the legally required SEC portfolio disclosures. Our approach is also superior to investing directly into hedge funds because we don’t like to invest in a hedge funds’ 35th best idea when we can invest in only the best stock picks of the best hedge funds.\n\nBelow we listed the 15 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of December 2020. We believe these are the 15 best stocks a beginner investor can buy today:\n\n15. Sea Limited (NYSE: SE): $267.50\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds: 115 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 95 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $10.9 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 13% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 34.4% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 20 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 38 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Tiger Global Management LLC\n\nChase Coleman of Tiger Global\n\nNumber of Hedge Funds: 116 (2020Q4) Number of Hedge Funds: 104 (2020Q3) Total Dollar Amount of Long Hedge Fund Positions: $15.6 billion Percent of Hedge Funds with Long Positions: 13.1% First Quarter Return (through February 18): 1.4% Popularity Ranking (2020Q3): 18 Popularity Ranking (2020Q2): 13 Noteworthy Hedge Fund Shareholders: Fisher Asset Management, Lone Pine Capital\n\nNetflix ranked 14th on our list of the best stocks to buy for beginner investors.

Here is what Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb has to say about The Walt Disney Company in their Q4 investor letter:\n\n“Disney is on the global trend toward subscription-based streaming video consumption, which we think is still in its early innings. As people increasingly watch their TV and movies via apps instead of cable bundles, we expect a relatively egalitarian media ecosystem that historically supported many winners to become much more elitist. The streaming model heavily favors scaled early movers, who benefit from a virtuous cycle in which massive content investment attracts incremental subscribers and revenues, which enable further content investment, which yields still more subscriber growth. Disney is investing heavily to drive this virtuous cycle, which is depressing their current profits, but people can only watch so much TV and wrap their arms around so much selection, which means that the growth of programming spend will eventually have to slow. If the world’s two most compelling collections of streamed video content continue to attract incremental subscribers amidst a moderating pace of investment, then content cost per subscriber will begin to fall, widening competitive gaps that are already very substantial by layering a cost advantage on top of a product quality advantage. As a result of this dynamic– which we think competitors will struggle to replicate– we believe that the leaders of the video entertainment industry’s streaming era will be far larger and more profitable than those of the cable era. While this possibility is by no means lost on the stock market, we invested in Disney because we believed their prices still failed to discount the degree to which we expect a small handful of victors to take most of the streaming era’s significantly greater spoils.”\n\n10. Apple Inc.

Paypal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been around since 2000. It started as an online payment platform for sending and receiving money. It gained popularity in a short span of time, becoming one of the world’s biggest online payment processors. Paypal has been enjoying tremendous growth lately, especially during 2020, with the stock gaining more than 120 percent during the past 12 months.\n\nThe growth in recent months has mainly been driven by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has greatly changed the way people work, shop, and transact. The lockdown restrictions fueled the use of digital payment methods, ultimately helping online payment processing companies such as Paypal.\n\nThe company announced record quarterly results for the quarter ended Dec. 31. It reported earnings of $1.57 billion, or $1.32 per share for the fourth quarter, translating to a surge of nearly 3 folds from the comparable period of 2019. On an adjusted basis, profit rose to $1.08 per share, easily beating the consensus forecast of $1 per share.\n\nCEO Dan Schulman said in a statement, “PayPal delivered record performance in 2020 as businesses of all sizes have digitized in the wake of the pandemic. In this historic year, we released more products than ever before and have dramatically scaled our acceptance worldwide, giving our 377 million consumer and merchant accounts even more reasons to use our platform.”\n\nRevenue came in at $6.12 billion, up 23 percent from $4.96 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were expecting Paypal to post revenue of $6.09 billion. Processed payments for the quarter climbed 39 percent to $277.1 billion. Moreover, net new active accounts in the quarter climbed by 16 million. Comparatively, Venmo’s active accounts jumped 32 percent to 70 million.\n\n8.

Polen Capital explained why they believe Alibaba will deliver large long-term returns in its Q4 investor letter:\n\n“One of our largest detractors during the quarter was Alibaba Group Holding Limited. Alibaba Group’s stock declined by over 20% during the fourth quarter. China delayed the Ant Financial initial public offering (IPO) and launched an anti-trust investigation into alleged anticompetitive practices by Alibaba. Many speculate that this was a strong signal from the government in response to comments made by Alibaba founder Jack Ma. Regardless of the reason, while we acknowledge that operating in China is different than in the U.S., we also recognize Alibaba’s dominance and importance to China’s long-term goals. As China reorients its economy from export-driven to domestic consumption, Alibaba’s platforms—Taobao and Tmall—are arguably the very best tools to achieve this. Alibaba enables commerce throughout the country from tier one cities to rural areas. Its competitive advantages, tailwinds in digital payments, e-commerce, and cloud technologies are poised for continued growth even with potential government penalties in the future. It remains one of our highest conviction positions.”\n\n6. Alphabet Inc.

            "Date": "2021-02-22",
            "Headline": "Alibaba, Pinduoduo Fight Against China’s Looming Food Crisis",
            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- The battle to supply 1.4 billion people with fresh fruit and vegetables is taking China’s e-commerce companies into the country’s hinterlands, where they are attempting to revolutionize centuries-old agricultural practices to secure future supply for their burgeoning online grocery businesses.\n\nXi Jinping’s government has long made self-sufficiency in food a “top state issue” as it seeks to avert a looming food crisis. The need to modernize China’s 200 million largely small-scale farms took on added urgency during the pandemic, when output and logistics disruptions coincided with homebound shoppers turning to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other internet retailers for their produce.\n\nNow, some of the country’s largest private companies have joined in with state efforts to help growers boost production, improve food quality and lower prices. For the e-commerce giants, it’s one way of strengthening their foothold in an online grocery market that’s expected to be worth more than $120 billion by 2023, without running afoul of Beijing’s recent crackdown on monopolistic practices like predatory pricing and forced exclusivity arrangements.\n\nIn Fujian along the eastern coast, Alibaba has provided chicken farmers with smart bracelets that track the health of their poultry, while under JD.com Inc.’s guidance, rice growers in China’s arid north have installed smart sensors to gain real-time insights for irrigation. Out west, scientists in Yunnan are teaming up with Pinduoduo Inc. to use artificial intelligence to automate strawberry planting.\n\n“Agriculture is a critical area supported by the Chinese government,” said Liu Yue, an analyst with market research firm EqualOcean. With rural youths flocking to cities for better jobs and food safety increasingly threatened by pesticides and outdated farming methods, the country’s tech champions are eager to lend Beijing a hand, she said.\n\nThe driving force behind the e-commerce platforms’ push into smart agriculture is the boom in online groceries, which is expected to double to about 820 billion yuan ($127 billion) by 2023 from last year, according to iResearch. The category overtook consumer electronics as the biggest contributor at JD.com in the first half last year, while Alibaba is making a bigger push into the business by taking a larger stake in hypermart Sun Art Retail Group Ltd.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, a clutch of smaller rivals ranging from Xingsheng Youxuan and MissFresh-- both backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. -- to Dingdong Maicai are in the process of raising billions of dollars to grab larger shares of the online fresh foods distribution market. That prompted state media to warn in December against overcrowding in the sector, saying instead that internet giants with immense data and advance algorithms should do more in technology innovation.\n\n“Covid-19 has helped accelerate the conversion of such purchases to online channels,” said Vey-Sern Ling, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “It’s a large untapped market, and the companies have to participate or be left behind.”\n\nAt a time when Chinese leaders are clamping down on monopolies in areas from fintech to e-commerce, smart agriculture is one sphere where the tech giants’ commercial interests are aligned with the national agenda.\n\nIn guidelines issued on Sunday, the State Council called for increased private investment to develop modern farming techniques and empower villages using advanced technologies. Breeding and cultivation sciences were also listed as one of Beijing’s top tech priorities for the next five years, alongside AI, quantum computing and computer chips. JD has said its smart farm projects are at least 50% funded by government subsidies.\n\nDespite the efforts, the growing appetite for fresh fruits and vegetables has left most of China’s traditionally labor-intensive farms -- roughly 98% of the 200 million operators are families or small businesses -- struggling to keep up. The country’s restrictions on land ownership and diverse terrain spanning the steppes of Inner Mongolia to the tropical shores of Hainan island in the south make it difficult to implement the industrial-scale farming that’s commonly seen in the U.S. and Europe. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics also show that about a third of farm workers are aged 55 or older, and the birthrate is at record lows, driving labor costs higher.\n\nLei Jinrong is one farmer who’s benefited from partnering with the online retailers. The owner of Fuxin Farm in Fujian province has equipped 1,000 of his chickens with Apple Watch-style bracelets supplied by Alibaba. The devices digitally track the number of steps the birds take each day and anything below 20,000 would be an early sign of illness, he said, adding that he no longer needs to patrol his fields in search of sick poultry.\n\nThe grower has also deployed street lamp-like devices that monitor air temperature, humidity and the level of toxic ammonia gas generated from bird waste, all displayed in real-time on a computer screen at his office. That has enabled Lei to expand production without hiring more workers -- good news as average salaries in his village have almost quadrupled over the past decade.\n\nIn the eastern province of Shandong, peach farmers increased revenue by 50% last year after using JD’s blockchain technology to encrypt each step of the planting process and increase trust and transparency, attracting consumers long weary of food scandals from tainted milk powder to imitation eggs.\n\n“The improved efficiency and the economies of scale will drive down costs while higher-quality produce will yield better prices,” said Charlie Chen, head of consumer research at China Renaissance in Hong Kong. This will benefit both farmers and the e-commerce operators, he said.\n\nPinduoduo, which raised $6.1 billion in November in part to finance its agricultural innovations, is counting on these efforts to help it quadruple sales of farm products to 1 trillion yuan by 2025. The company expects the initiatives to help it diversify beyond online retail, as it aims to license cutting-edge farming technology down the road, according to David Liu, vice president of strategy.\n\nMany of these initiatives are still in their infancy and scaling up will take time, as farmers have only recently started to collect data -- the foundation of running AI and other next-generation technologies -- and test new methods of growing. But the twin drivers of surging demand for online produce and Beijing’s push for self-sufficiency in food supplies means the tech behemoths’ forays into modernizing China’s farms have only just begun.\n\n“Smart agriculture is really the way to move forward,” said Lei, the chicken farmer. “We all have to innovate.”\n\n(Updates with more details from farmer in 13th paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Headline": "15 Most Valuable Cloud Computing Companies",
            "Text": "In this article, we are going to list the 15 Most Valuable Cloud Computing Companies. If you want to skip our discussion of the growth of the cloud computing industry and recent trends in the sector, go directly to the 5 Most Valuable Cloud Computing Companies.\n\nWhen venture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote his prescient essay titled \"Software Is Eating the World\" in 2011, many thought he was overreacting to the information technology boom. Today, software is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. At the core of this software revolution is Cloud. Companies are swiftly migrating to Cloud platforms to save costs, increase efficiency and accessibility. Interestingly, Andreessen had mention the rise of Cloud computing in his essay.\n\nIn 2000, when my partner Ben Horowitz was CEO of the first cloud computing company, Loudcloud, the cost of a customer running a basic Internet application was approximately $150,000 a month. Running that same application today in Amazon's cloud costs about $1,500 a month.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated the current trends in technology, hastening the adoption of certain innovations. For instance, the work-from-home trend fueled the demand for software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based solutions. Microsoft Teams reported a huge increase in the number of active users, from 44 million active users in March 2020 to 115 million daily users in October 2020.\n\nInvestors Pouring Money Into Cloud\n\nInvestors are also pouring money into the Cloud computing startups amid huge growth prospects and low risk factors involved. According to CB Insights, the number of deals in the cloud computing space reached 97 during the second quarter of 2020, up from 76 during the same period in 2019. Investors funneled about $3 billion into Cloud startups from April to June 2020.\n\nCompanies prefer to use Cloud solutions instead of using legacy hardware or software. However, security has been a major concern for companies that want to move to Cloud platforms. But several startups are racing to solve that problem. For example, Massachusetts-based startup Snyk Inc helps developers detect vulnerabilities in Cloud applications and resolve them. The company has raised over $400 million from investors. Similarly, Cockroach Labs that helps companies manage their data architecture over Cloud, raised over $86 million in Series E in January 2021 and was valued at about $2 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe AI Factor\n\nCloud computing services have revolutionized everything from contact monitoring to delivery services, telemedicine, and online shopping. The adaptation of technology during the coronavirus outbreak has greatly impacted the cloud computing industry. Cloud computing and AI along with IoT, are the main drivers in improving technology and growth in the Industrial 4.0 period. According to Oracle's Cloud 2020 report, about 60% of the 1,200 technology decision-makers surveyed in midsize and large companies across EMEA spoke in favor of an integrated solution approach and said that it would unlock the potential of disruptive technologies, such as robotics and artificial intelligence.\n\n15 most valuable cloud computing companies\n\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning are the key enablers to improve the efficiency and speed of cloud computing services. In return, cloud-based services will fuel important technological innovations including contact tracing as part of pandemic response planning, smart city infrastructure, and the development of autonomous vehicles.\n\nA Growing Industry\n\nAccording to the in-depth market analysis from Markets and Markets , the global cloud computing industry was valued at $371 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach a market value of $832 billion by 2025 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.5%. In 2019, North America dominated the global cloud computing market with a share of 49% due to the early adoption of cloud computing technologies.\n\nThe cloud computing market is dominated and owned by the biggest tech companies in the world such as SAP, IBM, Oracle, Amazon, and Microsoft. These cloud computing giants have a large market share and a strong global reach along with organized distribution networks, which help them increase their revenues.

            "Date": "2021-02-23",
            "Headline": "4 Reasons Baidu Should Divest Its Stake in iQiyi",
            "Text": "Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), the Chinese tech giant that owns the country's largest online search engine, launched its online video platform iQiyi (NASDAQ:IQ) in 2010.\n\nBaidu spun off iQiyi in an IPO in 2018 but retained a majority stake in the company, which still generated 28% of its total revenue in fiscal 2020. In the past, that relationship was beneficial because iQiyi's stronger revenue growth offset the ongoing declines in Baidu's core advertising business.\n\nUnfortunately, iQiyi's growth gradually fizzled out due to competition from similar platforms like Tencent (OTC:TCEHY) Video and Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Youku Tudou, as well as short video platforms like ByteDance's Douyin (known as TikTok overseas) and Kuaishou.\n\nAs a result, iQiyi is becoming more of a liability than an asset for Baidu and the company should divest its remaining 56% stake in iQiyi. Here are four simple reasons why.\n\n1. iQiyi's growth has peaked\n\niQiyi's number of paid subscribers declined 5% year over year to 101.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Its revenue dipped 1% to 7.5 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) due to declines in both subscription and advertising revenue.\n\niQiyi's revenue rose 2% for the full year, but that growth mainly occurred in the first half of the year when the pandemic sparked a temporary jump in stay-at-home subscribers. After hitting 118.9 million subscribers in the first quarter, that figure declined sequentially over the following three quarters.\n\niQiyi attributed its slowdown to a shortage of new content during the pandemic and believes the production of new shows and movies will bring back subscribers. Unfortunately, iQiyi still expects its revenue to slide 2%-8% year over year in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, Baidu's online marketing business, which generated 62% of its revenue from ads in 2020, just posted its seventh straight quarter of year-over-year declines. iQiyi's growth offset those declines throughout 2019 and early 2020, but it probably won't do any more heavy lifting this year.\n\n2. A dead weight on its bottom line\n\niQiyi was dubbed the \"Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) of China\" when it went public. But that's a lazy comparison that glosses over two key differences between the companies.\n\nFirst, iQiyi is a \"freemium\" platform that provides both ad-supported videos for free users and premium content for subscribers, while Netflix only offers premium content. Second, Netflix is consistently profitable, but iQiyi isn't.\n\niQiyi's inability to generate a profit after all these years -- due to high cloud hosting, content licensing, and production costs -- is troubling. Its net loss narrowed from 10.3 billion yuan in 2019 to 7.0 billion yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2020, but that was partly because it was producing and licensing less content during the pandemic.\n\nIf iQiyi was sacrificing its margins to generate robust revenue growth, it might make sense for Baidu to hold on to its stake. But right now, iQiyi is simply a dead weight on both Baidu's top and bottom lines -- and it would make sense to jettison the unit to focus on its higher-growth businesses.\n\n3. Baidu owns more promising businesses\n\nBaidu's revenue rose 5% year over year in the fourth quarter, marking its second straight quarter of growth even as its online marketing and iQiyi segments floundered. That's because the growth of Baidu's cloud business, which is included in its \"others\" segment, offset those declines.\n\nIt largely attributed the 52% growth of Baidu Core's non-marketing services to its \"cloud and other services\" during the fourth quarter. During the conference call, it noted Baidu's AI cloud revenue rose 67% year over year, with an annualized run rate of 2 billion yuan ($310 million), or 12% of its top line.\n\nBut Baidu is still an underdog in this market. It only controlled 7.1% of China's cloud platform market in the third quarter of 2020, according to Canalys, putting it in a distant fourth place behind Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Huawei, and Tencent.\n\nSo instead of diverting more of its cash and resources to iQiyi, which already tried to stem its own losses with new debt and stock offerings last year, Baidu should simply sell the unit and expand its higher-growth cloud business instead.\n\nThat divestment could also free up more resources for Baidu's upcoming integration of YY Live, the live video platform it plans to buy from JOYY (NASDAQ:YY), or its various AI, driverless technology, biotech, and chipmaking ventures.\n\n4. There are plenty of potential buyers\n\nBaidu was reportedly in talks to sell its stake in iQiyi to Alibaba and Tencent last year, but the government's antitrust probes postponed those efforts.\n\nHowever, China's antitrust probes mainly focus on Alibaba's e-commerce business, its fintech affiliate Ant Group, and Tencent's WeChat Pay instead of streaming video platforms like iQiyi, Tencent Video, and Youku Tudou. Therefore, Baidu could restart those talks if the regulatory headwinds wane.\n\nIf Alibaba and Tencent walk away, Baidu could still potentially sell iQiyi to Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF), which took a stake in the business back in 2014. In other words, there are plenty of potential buyers if Baidu finally realizes that iQiyi isn't a crucial part of its sprawling business."

            "Text": "Online luxury platform Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) is expected to see the number of active shoppers on its site soar to at least 30 million in the next five years as its partnership with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Richemont (OTC:CFRUY) brings in incremental new demand from Chinese consumers.\n\nLast November, Alibaba and Richemont committed to investing over $1.1 billion in the luxury goods marketplace with the three companies forming a joint venture called Farfetch China.\n\nAn enriching experience\n\nIn a research note to investors, Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) analyst Stephen Ju wrote that Farfetch is likely to turn in strong fourth-quarter earnings numbers when it reports on Thursday. He also believes the first six months of 2021 will be one of superlatives, but the real opportunity for the platform comes from its integration into Alibaba's Luxury Pavilion.\n\nLaunched in 2017 on Tmall, Alibaba's business-to-consumer (B2C) shopping site, the Luxury Pavilion is an invitation-only platform offering products that include not only clothes and skincare, but also fashion accessories like watches, and luxury cars. Upscale retailers such as Burberry, Hugo Boss, and Maserati are featured.\n\nFarfetch launched new shopping channels on Tmall, Luxury Soho (a platform for young, but value-minded luxury consumers), and cross-border site Tmall Global, enabling it to tap into Alibaba's nearly 760 million consumers.\n\nJu forecasts Farfetch will end the fourth quarter with 3 million active shoppers on its platform, but believes it can multiply that tenfold over the next five years. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock to $85 per share from $53. Farfetch closed on Monday at just under $68, indicating there is still 25% upside to its stock.\n\nJu maintained an outperform rating on the growth stock's shares."

            "Text": "In this article we are going to list the 20 most valuable companies in the world in February 2021. Click to skip ahead and jump to the 10 Most Valuable Companies In The World in February 2021.\n\n2020 has been the worst year for the world since the end of the WWII. Unless you've been living under a rock, you know that the coronavirus pandemic struck China, in Wuhan, who initially held details about the same, refusing to cooperate and release the appropriate information which would have allowed other countries to battle it. As it was, the virus was transmitted from China to several other countries, and rather than an epidemic in a specific area, became a global pandemic within a couple of months.\n\nAs little was known about the origins of the virus as well as how to battle it, countries were completely unprepared even as things went south really fast. The virus spread at an incredible speed, and infected millions of people, with a fatality rate much higher than the flu, to which it was compared initially on. Since countries did not know how to battle the virus or how to cure those who were infected, lockdowns were swiftly implemented. Often called draconian initially before being realized as necessary, these lockdowns brought the world to a standstill, as billions of people were unable to leave their homes and economies came to a screeching halt. Most industries across the world were shut down, with only necessary businesses being able to operate. While those who could work from home managed to persevere, for example in the tech industry, other industries such as the construction industry were completely rattled.\n\nMost Valuable Companies In The World in 2021\n\nVintage Tone/Shutterstock.com\n\nHowever, perhaps few industries had to bear the impact of the virus like the hospitality and airline industry. Even before lockdowns were implemented, countries started banning international travel from China and other countries where the virus spread quickly. Because of this, international flights came to a standstill as well. I remember returning through Dubai International Airport in March 2020 and finding it completely abandoned. As someone who had always seen the airport full of passengers bustling about, it was kind of eerie noting how most of the lounges were empty and even the duty free, paradise for most shoppers, was completely empty too. And since travel was banned, the hospitality industry, including hotels, suffered a lot as well. Hotels were unable to find occupants and had to slash rates and still lose out on tons of money. In fact, airlines are expected to have lost around $84.3 billion, according to the the International Air Transport Association.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis brings us to 2021. While many people couldn't wait to see the end of 2020, 2021 hasn't started out so well, has it? The United States and the United Kingdom, along with many other countries starting reporting a record number of cases and deaths as the second wave caused even more devastation than the first, resulting in many countries, including the UK, France and Germany reintroducing complete or partial lockdowns, which again devastated economies. In fact, most of the countries across the world have suffered from either a recession or a depression in the past year, and apart from China, few countries are aiming for their economy to be back on track anytime soon.\n\nHowever, there's always light at the end of the tunnel, and the development of vaccines which have proven efficient against the Covid-19 pandemic has renewed belief that we might at the end of this year, finally say goodbye to one of the worst incidents in history. And the development and implementation of the vaccine in less than a year by multiple companies, when the process generally take 5 years if at all, shows how far we have come in technology and advancement. To the companies which have developed the vaccines, this will result in additional revenues of several billion dollars.\n\nOf course, even the effects of a pandemic aren't equal across any of the metrics. For example, in the United States, while the coronavirus took off a year in life expectancy of the white population, it actually took off three years from the life expectancy of the black population. Blacks were also a lot more likely to be infected and suffer from the virus as compared to the white population, primarily due to the fact that black people in the US don't have access to the same level of healthcare that white people do.\n\nWhile most companies and industries suffered, not everyone did. The biggest companies in the world in February 2021 were able to navigate through the pandemic relatively unhindered. These companies had enough reserves and resources to battle the effects of the pandemic, while many, especially those in the tech and online retailing industry, actually saw their numbers grow vastly. The tech industry actually saw many companies grow significantly and while tens of millions of people lost their jobs, billionaires saw their total net worth increase by $637 billion, with Elon Musk alone gaining more than $120 billion within a single year, the biggest annual increase ever seen in the net worth of a person (see 25 Highest Earning Billionaires in 2020). This happened even as Tesla continued defying expectations and having its value grow astronomically to the point that is now among the most valuable companies in the world, while just a couple of years ago, it was nowhere close to achieving this.\n\nOf the 15 most valuable companies in February 2021, 9 are from the United States of America. This is because of the fact that the United States has more lax rules and regulations as compared to Europe, and encourages capitalism, which allows companies to become bigger than most countries. The 20 biggest companies in the world right now have a market cap exceeding $16 trillion. Two of these companies are currently worth more than $2 trillion, while 5 companies are worth more than $1 trillion. All the data in this article, where the companies are ranked by market cap, has been taken from Yahoo Finance, with foreign currencies being converted to USD based on the current exchange rate. So without further ado, let's take a look at the 20 most valuable companies in the world, starting with number 20:\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $338\n\nThe financial services company processes payments between banks and customers, and currently has around 19,000 employees. Here is what Del Principe O’Brien Financial Advisors recently said about MA:\n\n“The market pullback in the spring gave us a chance to become owners of Mastercard, one of the biggest players in the global payments industry. In fiscal year 2019, the company processed almost $5 trillion in purchase transactions and holds 29% of the global market share for credit cards and 24% of the global market for debit cards. In June, Mastercard entered into an agreement to acquire Finicity, a financial data and insight provider, for a purchase price of $825 million. The move is meant to strengthen Mastercard’s existing open banking platform. Open banking is a system that gives third parties, including other banks and tech start-ups that provide financial services (think budgeting apps), digital access to financial data. A user-focused innovation in the banking industry, open banking is thought to be the future of banking. We see an active investment in its open banking platform as a good move for Mastercard toward maintaining its leadership in the global market.”\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $351.88\n\nDisney is one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world, and with its recent launch of Disney+, a streaming service, it aims to continue its dominance for many years to come. Disney reported an adjusted profit of 32 cents per share for the three months ended January 2, contrary to a loss of 34 cents per share forecasted by analysts. Revenue for the quarter came in at $16.25 billion, down from $20.88 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts on average were looking for revenue of $15.93 billion.\n\nRevenue from the Disney Parks, Experiences and Products segment declined 53 percent on a year-over-year basis to $3.6 billion, as Disney theme parks stayed closed during the quarter. Comparatively, revenue from the Media and Entertainment Distribution slipped 5 percent to $12.66 billion.\n\nOn the bright side, Disney+ subscriptions reached 94.9 million in the quarter, well above the consensus forecast of 90.7 million.\n\nSpeaking on the results, CEO Bob Chapek said, “we believe the strategic actions we’re taking to transform our Company will fuel our growth and enhance shareholder value, as demonstrated by the incredible strides we’ve made in our DTC business, reaching more than 146 million total paid subscriptions across our streaming services at the end of the quarter.”\n\nStates with the Best Roads in America\n\nspatuletail/Shutterstock.com\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $365.495\n\nNVDA ranks 18th in our list of the most valuable companies in the world. NVDA is primarily involved in the production of graphics processing units for gamers as well as professionals, and has also dabbled in artificial intelligence. Here is what Vulcan Value Partners has to say about NVIDIA Corporation in their 2020 Q3 investor letter:\n\n“NVIDIA Corp. is the dominant supplier of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) worldwide. During the first quarter of 2019, its stock price declined considerably due to the combination of three factors. A capital spending hiatus by cloud providers, the collapse in demand for cryptocurrency mining, along with the end of the product cycle in its most recent gaming chip caused NVIDIA to miss its quarterly earnings estimates. As a result, we were given the opportunity to purchase NVIDIA with a significant margin of safety in March of 2019. NVIDIA’s value grew substantially while we owned it, and we continued to follow our discipline by trimming and adding to the company as its price fluctuated. We exited NVIDIA when its stock price rose close to our estimate of fair value. The combination of its value growth and the closing of the price to value gap provided substantial returns over our investment period.”\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $388.422\n\nWalmart is the biggest retailer in the world, and in terms of revenue, is comfortably the biggest company in the world, with revenue greater than half a trillion dollars in 2019. The company on Thursday announced mixed results for the fourth quarter along with a weak outlook. Walmart reported a loss of $2.09 billion, or 74 cents per share for the quarter, as compared to earnings of $1.45 per share in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, the retail giant reported a profit of $1.39 per share that missed the consensus forecast of $1.51 per share.\n\nRevenue came in at $152.08 billion, beating analysts’ average estimate of $148.51 billion. U.S. comparable sales in the quarter rose 8.6 percent, while analysts were looking for a rise of 5.6 percent. On the bright side, online sales in the U.S. skyrocketed 69 percent, well above a 35 percent surge in the comparable quarter of the prior year. Comparatively, same-store sales at Sam’s Club rose 8.5 percent in Q4.\n\nHowever, Walmart incurred $1.1 billion in pandemic-related costs during the quarter, as it had to pay bonuses to front-line workers and spend more to ensure the cleanliness of its stores. Nevertheless, the company increased its annual dividend by 2 percent to 55 cents, besides approving a stock repurchase plan worth $20 billion.\n\nwalmart, supermarket, store, market, canada, sign, door, shop, exterior, billboard, ontario, retail, building, cheap, storefront, board, retailer, toronto, advertisement,\n\nNiloo / Shutterstock.com\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $425.182\n\nJ&J is one of the biggest pharma companies in the world, and has also developed a vaccine recently to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $443\n\nThe company is partially owned by the state of China, and is the biggest beverage company in the world right now.\n\nPublic Domain/Pixabay\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $456.9\n\nOne of the biggest and most controversial banks in the US is also among the most valuable companies in the world in February 2021.\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $460.49\n\nVisa ranks 13th on our list of the most valuable companies in the world. If you have a debit or credit card, its most likely either Visa or MasterCard, and is among the biggest financial services companies in terms of market cap. MoffettNathanson’s Senior Equity Analyst, Lisa Ellis, rated both Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE: MA) and Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) as stocks to watch and included in her ‘buy’ list. “What people don’t realize is that a lot of the spending if you use a service like a firm or Afterpay or PayPal, is actually going over cards, sometimes it’s a debit card instead of a credit card,” said Ellis in a short interview with CNBC.\n\n“When you break up these transactions from one big Peloton to lots of investments for that Peloton, those underlying companies actually make more money because they make more money off of lots of smaller transactions instead of a big one.”, she said while noting that the rise of after pay companies like PayPal will be much of a benefit for Mastercard and Visa since they are the companies behind these famous payment services.\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $501\n\nSamsung ranks 11th on our list of the most valuable companies in the world. Samsung is a market leader in many electronics industries, including smartphones, televisions and sound systems and has assembly plants in 74 countries.\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nTotal market cap of the company as at February 22, 2021 (in billions of dollars): $575.545\n\nIn terms of revenue, it is the biggest financial services companies in the world, and is also among the biggest investment companies in the world.\n\nPlease continue to see the 10 Most Valuable Companies in February 2021.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 most valuable companies in February 2021 is originally published at Insider Monkey."

            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, once the most valuable company in China, is turning from a global hedge fund favorite to something less than desirable.Investors from hedge fund titans such as Point72 Asset Management and Moore Capital Management to Canadian and U.S. pension funds dumped 101 million of Alibaba’s American depositary receipts in the fourth quarter, cutting the market value of their holdings by $89 billion, according to filing data. It was the biggest investment reduction among U.S. traded companies, more than three times the second-most sold stock, Salesforce.com Inc..\n\nOnce a symbol of China’s New Economy, the e-commerce giant founded by Jack Ma now finds itself at the forefront of the government’s campaign to rein in the sprawling power of tech giants. Alibaba’s shares, which are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, have slumped about 18% since November, when regulators in Beijing halted the $35 billion initial public offering of Alibaba’s affiliate Ant Group at the last minute. Government watchdogs have also ordered Ant to overhaul its business and began an antitrust investigation of Alibaba.\n\nMeanwhile, Alibaba, which has invested in a wide range of sectors from online grocery to ride-hailing and artificial intelligence, will face restraints on future expansion. Chinese antitrust watchdogs used to pay little attention to investment led by internet companies, but have begun strengthening enforcement amid Beijing’s push to root out monopoly power. In December, China’s antitrust watchdog fined Alibaba and two other companies over years-old acquisitions. Regulators said the e-commerce heavyweight should have sought government approval before increasing its stake in a department store chain in 2017.\n\nIf someone were to make an example of how to take down a monopoly in China, they’ve got nothing better than Alibaba, said Rajiv Jain, who oversees $73 billion in assets as chairman of GQG Partners LLC in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “The long-term growth trajectory is now different from what we thought.”GQG liquidated all of its 9.6 million ADRs in the fourth quarter, valued at $2.8 billion, according to filing data. Jain said he had owned Alibaba shares since the company’s initial public offering in 2014, when he was the chief investment officer at Vontobel Asset Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Alibaba spokesperson declined to comment on investors selling the stock.\n\nInvestors are questioning whether Alibaba can sustain its meteoritic rise amid the regulatory scrutiny. It now could face penalties of as much as 10% of its revenue if it’s found to have violated antitrust rules. Those rules are against practices such as forced exclusive arrangements with merchants, known as “Pick One of Two,” predatory pricing and algorithms favoring new users. Tightening government oversight also threatens to curb Ant’s dominance in online payments and scale back its expansion into consumer lending and wealth management.\n\nAlibaba has said that it’s working with regulators on complying with their requirements as the antitrust investigations continue. Share prices have recovered somewhat since Ma resurfaced in late January after vanishing from the public sight following the government’s crackdown on his businesses. The shares fell about 1% to $250.34 in New York Wednesday.\n\nAlibaba sellers are Who’s Who of hedge fund stars. Steve Cohen’s Point72 dumped all its $413 million in holdings last quarter fourth quarter. Louis Bacon’s Moore Capital slashed its holdings by 99%, while Dan Loeb’s Third Point cut its stake by 45%.\n\nOther prominent investors cashing out include Hillhouse Capital Advisors, which sold its $1.2 billion holdings. Canada Pension Plan Investment Board reduced its stake by 31%, or $2.1 billion.\n\nIzzy Englander’s Millennium Management LLC was among a minority group of investors who scooped up Alibaba, counting it as its sixth-largest holdings.\n\nRepresentatives at these firms either declined to comment or didn’t reply to emails or calls.\n\nRather than pulling out, some investors may have swapped their ADRs with shares traded in Hong Kong to avoid the risk of being caught in the political tension between the U.S. and China, said Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at Krane Funds Advisors LLC, which runs several China-focused exchange-traded funds in the U.S.Former U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation in December that could kick Chinese companies off of U.S. exchanges unless American regulators can review their financial audits. The administration had also considered banning U.S. investments in Chinese companies, including Alibaba and Tencent, before deciding against it.\n\n“Alibaba is a very well-managed company,” said Ahern. “We are a big believer in the company and management.”Analysts share Ahern’s upbeat sentiment. All but three of 61 analysts rate the company as a buy.For GQG’s Jain, the regulatory uncertainties mean the risk-reward calculation is stacking against Alibaba. For instance, it’s becoming much more difficult for the company to grow its business by acquiring smaller players.\n\n“There’s more downside than upside,” said Jain, whose Goldman Sachs GQG Partners International Opportunities Fund beat 83% of its peers over the past three years. “The regulatory risk is usually underappreciated until it’s too late. In other words, you cannot handicap that.”\n\n(Update with Ailbaba’s share price in ninth paragraph.)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Text": "(Bloomberg) -- Tencent Holdings Ltd.-backed Yuanfudao is seeking fresh funding at a valuation of more than $20 billion, people familiar with the matter said, as the cash-burning battle in China’s online education arena shows no sign of abating.\n\nThe Beijing-based tutoring app is planning to raise at least $1 billion and has held discussions with investors including Boyu Capital and DCP Capital, according to people familiar with the matter. The funding round has yet to be finalized and the size will depend on investor interest, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.\n\nThe latest fundraising comes less than six months after a $2.2 billion round that valued the startup at $15.5 billion, the most among edtech companies globally, Yuanfudao said at the time. The tutoring upstart is competing with top teaching providers like TAL Education Group as well as the education wings of internet giants like ByteDance Ltd. for a bigger share of China’s private education industry.\n\nYuanfudao -- backed by investors like Hillhouse Capital and IDG -- is seeking to boost its valuation ahead of a possible stock market debut in 2022, said the people. Yuanfudao said in a statement that it doesn’t have any formal fundraising plans. Boyu and DCP declined to comment.\n\nChina’s edtech firms are replenishing their war chests after splashing out hundreds of millions to grow their operations during 2020’s pandemic lockdowns. The country’s online education startups attracted a total of $9.2 billion last year, more than quadruple the funds raised in 2019, according to research firm Zero2IPO Group. In January, close rival Zuoyebang raised $1.6 billion from investors including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and SoftBank Vision Fund.\n\nThe unfettered expansion has drawn the ire of Beijing, which has signaled its intention to rein in the mounting influence of tech companies in the world’s No. 2 economy. The country’s education ministry has hit out at questionable behaviors from the companies, ranging from excessive advertising to the use of unapproved teaching materials, the official paper of the Communist Party’s disciplinary watchdog wrote last month. Yuanfudao, for its part, has sponsored popular web series as well as China’s annual Spring Festival TV gala this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nFounded in 2012, Yuanfudao offers a variety of online education products from live-streaming courses to test prepping, with more than 400 million users across China. The firm has also set up offline teaching facilities, with more than 30,000 employees.\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\n©2021 Bloomberg L.P."

            "Headline": "Ray Dalio’s Top 10 Stock Picks for 2021",
            "Text": "In this article, we take a look at billionaire Ray Dalio's top 10 stock picks for 2021. You can skip our detailed discussion of Ray Dalio's investment philosophy and go directly to Ray Dalio's Top 5 Stocks Picks for 2021.\n\nThe American billionaire Raymond Thomas Dalio’s hedge fund Bridgewater Associates saw big losses in 2020 as the quant hedge fund’s computer-based stock-picking strategies failed to accurately predict the pandemic-related downturn. Quantitative stock investing strategies rely on historical data and market patterns. Unfortunately, the stock price movements during the pandemic year were unprecedented, resulting in a loss of more than $12 billion for the world’s all-time best-performing hedge fund in 2020.\n\n\"We have never had a significant downturn, all positive years, but we knew that there would come a day,\" Dalio said in a Bloomberg TV interview. \"We missed the pandemic going down, and that is the reality.\"\n\nDespite the hefty losses in 2020, Bridgewater Associates leads the hedge fund industry, with net gains of $46.5 billion since inception. The billionaire is also optimistic about the future performance and his hedge fund's ability to earn back what it lost in 2020. The quant hedge fund has made several changes in its portfolio to benefit from changing market trends. This is what Westport, Connecticut-based Bridgewater said in a statement.\n\n“Investors believe this environment, where the world is changing rapidly, is a strong environment for a firm like ours that is so committed to understanding how the world works,”\n\nRay Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has initiated positions in 169 stocks during the fourth quarter to outperform the market trends in 2021. However, none of the new stock positions are big enough to be included in Ray Dalio’s top 10 stock picks. The firm also added to its 233 existing positions. Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has also significantly trimmed its portfolio exposure towards the financial sector, which represented only 36% of the overall portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter, compared to 81% of the overall portfolio at the end of the previous quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Bridgewater Associates has expressed confidence in several companies from the consumer staples sectors. These include Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG). Investments in the consumer staples sector represented 21.5% of the overall portfolio, according to the latest 13F filings.\n\nThe hedge fund sold out 74 positions and reduced stakes in 122 stock positions during the fourth quarter. The largest cuts include a 45% drop in its GLD SPDR Gold Trust position and a 7% decline in SPY SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust position. The firm started fiscal 2021 with $11.55 billion in 13F portfolio market value and $235 billion worth of total assets under management.\n\nRay Dalio's investment firm, which also establishes its future investment strategies based on the macroeconomic trends, says the current cyclical economic environment offers both risk and opportunities for investors. Bridgewater stated this in their 2021 economic outlook report:\n\n\"In the markets, the biggest opportunities and the biggest risks arise when you have a confluence of unsustainable flows of money and credit forming prices that discount unlikely future economic scenarios. Today, we see a number of such opportunities and risks unfolding over both cyclical and secular time frames, including the risk of severe wealth destruction if the new paradigm of zero interest rates and coordinated monetary and fiscal policy (MP3) is pushed to its limits,\"\n\nRay Dailo’s Top 10 Stock Picks for 2021\n\nRay Dalio of Bridgewater Associates\n\nWhile Ray Dalio's reputation remains intact, the same can’t be said of the hedge fund industry as a whole, as its reputation has been tarnished in the last decade during which its hedged returns couldn’t keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. On the other hand, Insider Monkey’s research was able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 88 percentage points since March 2017. Between March 2017 and February 5th 2021 our monthly newsletter's stock picks returned 187.5%, vs. 75.8% for the SPY. Our stock picks outperformed the market by more than 111 percentage points (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that significantly underperformed the market. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 and they lost 13% through November 16. That’s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to. You can subscribe to our free newsletter on our homepage to receive our stories in your inbox.\n\nRay Dalio is a distinguished author and actively publishes long essays on his LinkedIn profile. His essay series titled “The Changing World Order” garnered a massive engagement online. The billionaire, who suffered the tragic loss of his son earlier this year, has also authored “Principles,” a book highlighting Dalio’s investment and life philosophy. Dalio’s video on YouTube titled “How The Economic Machine Works” has received over 21 million views.\n\nLet’s start examining Ray Dalio’s top 10 stock picks for 2021 to see whether the portfolio adjustments would help the billionaire hedge fund manager to outperform the market trends. The top ten positions represent 42% of the overall Bridgewater Associates portfolio.\n\n10. Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ: PDD)\n\nRay Dalio’s top 10 stock picks for 2021 include Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ: PDD). Bridgewater first initiated a position in the Chines platform during the fourth quarter of 2019 and added to its existing position in the December quarter of 2020. PDD is the tenth-largest stock holding of Ray Dalio’s 13F portfolio, according to the latest filings. The shares of the Chinese e-commerce platform grew more than 400% in 2020 and extended the upside momentum into 2021.\n\nTao Value, which returned 26.43% for the fourth quarter, highlighted few stocks including Pinduoduo in a Q4 investor letter. Here is what Tao Value stated:\n\n“Pinduoduo (ticker: PDD) reported a very strong Q3 2020, beating key KPIs all-around (GMV, active buyers & Revenue). It even surprisingly recorded the first non-GAAP profit (RMB466 million). Yet, the more important development is Duoduo Maicai, a new fresh grocery initiative. It is a natural extension of Pinduoduo’s deep root in agriculture e-commerce, and I think the logistic expertise it accumulated over years should help them compete. It is also a very nascent market, which attracts other tech giants (including Meituan & Alibaba). I will watch very closely on the developments.”\n\n9. iShares Gold Trust ETF (NYSEARCA: IAU)\n\nRay Dalio continues showing confidence in gold markets over the last two years. However, his position in iShares Gold Trust ETF (IAU) underperformed since the beginning of this year due to pressure on gold prices. IAU ranks 9th on the list of Ray Dalio's top 10 stock picks, accounting for 2.43% of the overall portfolio. The firm first initiated a position in iShares Gold Trust ETF (IAU) in 2017. iShares Gold Trust invests in the commodity markets, particularly in gold. Formed in 2005, the fund seeks to track the daily performance of the price of gold bullion.\n\n8. iShares Core S&P 500 ETF\n\nBridgewater Associates seeks to capitalize on the broader market bull-run through investment in iShares Core S&P 500 ETF. The firm has increased its position in iShares Core S&P 500 ETF during the fourth quarter by 30%. It is among the long-running investments of Ray Dalio as the firm has been holding a position in iShares Core S&P 500 ETF since 2010. The price of iShares Core S&P 500 ETF grew almost 16% in the last twelve months, extending the ten years gains to 190%.\n\niShares Core S&P 500 ETF is managed by BlackRock Fund Advisors and invests in stocks of companies operating across diversified sectors. It invests in growth and value stocks of large-cap companies in order to track the performance of the S&P 500 Index using a representative sampling technique.\n\n7. iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA: IEMG)\n\nBridgewater has benefited from its position in iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) in 2020 because the price of MSCI Emerging Markets ETFs grew 29% in the last twelve months. Despite the past performance, Ray Dalio still looks bullish over the future performance of emerging markets. Consequently, the billionaire hedge fund manager has increased his position by 70% in iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF during the fourth quarter. MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is an exchange-traded fund that invests in public equity markets of the global emerging region.\n\n6. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA)\n\nThe largest Chinese e-commerce platform Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) is among Ray Dalio’s top 10 stock picks for 2021. Despite pressure on BABA’s shares due to regulatory and political issues, Bridgewater Associates looks confident about the future prospects. The firm raised its position in BABA by 19% in the fourth quarter to 3.22% of the overall portfolio.\n\nIn a Q4 investor letter, Miller Value Partners, which returned 35.4% for the fourth quarter, highlighted factors behind slower-than-expected performance from Alibaba. Here is what Miller Value Partners stated:\n\n“Alibaba (BABA) had quite the quarter rising up to a high of $317 in October only to end the quarter down 20% after the delay of the Ant IPO and the announced investigations by the Chinese government into monopolistic practices at the firm. There was additional pressure on the stock as the US House of Representatives passed a bill that threatens to delist Chinese companies from US exchanges unless US regulators are able to inspect their financial audits within three years. During the quarter, the company increased their share buyback program from $6B to $10B. The company report second quarter FY21 results that were largely in-line with expectations. The company reported revs of Rmb155.1B (USD 23.9B) slightly beating consensus of Rmb 153.9B (USD 23.7B) and adjusted EBITDA of Rmb 47.5B (USD 7.3B) versus 41.3B (USD 6.3B). The company maintained full year guidance for revenues of Rmb 650B (USD 100.3B).”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Ray Dalio’s Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nDisclosure: None.

            "Text": "Benzinga\n\nWarren Buffett in his annual letter to shareholders offered words of encouragement to a battered country while also signaling that more stock buybacks are to come. Buffett's Annual Letter: The letter from the 90-year-old chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) was even more anticipated than usual this year, because his influential voice has largely been silent since his last letter, which came in the very early days of the pandemic. A lot has happened since, from the contentious election and ensuing fallout, to the arrival of retailer investors pushing \"stonks,\" not to mention the meteoric rise of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). Buffett's lieutenant, Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, spoke on Wednesday about some of these issues. He said the trading in stocks such as GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) was tantamount to \"betting on racehorses\" and cast doubt on the idea that Bitcoin will ever replace regular money as the world's primary medium of exchange. Buffett in his letter did not talk about cryptocurrency or GameStop, but he did touch on the turmoil of the past year, without directly referencing any particular event. He used the stories of companies throughout the country that he has invested in, such as GEICO and Pilot Travel Centers, to deliver a simple, clear message: \"Never bet against America.\" (Italics in original.) \"There has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country’s economic progress has been breathtaking,\" he wrote. \"Beyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming 'a more perfect union.' Progress on that front has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so.\" Earnings, Stock Repurchases: As for the latest numbers on the company's performance, the letter showed Berkshire earned $42.5 billion last year, down 48% from 2019's $81.4 billion. This included an $11 billion loss from a write-down in subsidiary and affiliate businesses, particularly the 2016 purchase of Portland, Oregon-based metal fabricator Precision Castparts. The company does business in the aerospace industry — not the best one to be in last year. In his letter, Buffett said he overpaid for the company and that last year's \"adverse developments\" in the industry made that clear. \"I was simply too optimistic about PCC’s normalized profit potential,\" Buffett wrote. The company spent $24.7 billion to repurchase the equivalent of 80,998 \"A\" shares last year, including $9 billion in the fourth quarter. That is likely to continue: \"Berkshire has repurchased more shares since year-end and is likely to further reduce its share count in the future,\" Buffett wrote. Berkshire also as usual listed its top holdings by market value. They included Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE: KO), American Express Company (NYSE: AXP) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC). Filings from Berkshire earlier this month showed the company trimmed its positions in Apple while piling into drug, telecom and oil companies in the latest quarter. Recent Price Action: Berkshire's class B shares ended Friday at $240.51, down for the week at 0.54%. Class A shares were down 0.88% to $364,580. Photo Courtesy Wikimedia Commons.

            "Text": "InvestorPlace\n\nIn the last few days, electric vehicle stocks have witnessed some sharp correction. I am not surprised given the fact that EV stocks went ballistic during the last year. There is also no reason to panic with various estimates pointing to an inflection point in the EV industry. I see the correction as a good opportunity to accumulate some quality stocks. Stock-price action aside, the electric vehicle industry is in top-gear. To put things into perspective, by fiscal year 2022, there will be 500 different EV models available globally. This implies intense competition. However, the number of passenger electric vehicles (on-road) is expected to increase at a CAGR of 31.4% in the next decade. This growth will allow multiple players to survive and create shareholder value.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips 8 Stocks to Buy for March Let’s discuss seven electric vehicle stocks that have an exciting product line-up for the year: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) XPeng (NYSE:XPEV) CIIG Merger (NASDAQ:CIIC) Churchill Capital (NYSE:CCIV) Niu Technologies (NASDAQ:NIU) Electrameccanica Vehicles (NASDAQ:SOLO) NextGen Acquisition (NASDAQ:NGAC) Electric Vehicle Stocks: Tesla (TSLA) Source: Grisha Bruev / Shutterstock.com Any discussion on electric vehicles stocks is incomplete without TSLA stock. After peaking at about $900, TSLA stock recently declined below $700. The correction seems like a good opportunity to accumulate the stock. Tesla has an exciting product line for the next two years. This is likely to ensure that the company’s sales volumes continue to keep the markets happy. Tesla Cybertruck is likely to hit the markets toward the end of the year. Elon Musk believes that the company will be “able to do a few deliveries toward the end of this year.” However, volume production is likely in the coming year. With more than 500,000 pre-orders, the markets will be looking forward to see the final version of Cybertruck. Further, Tesla has already started taking pre-bookings for Tesla Model S Plaid. With deliveries starting toward the end of the year, the premium model boasts of three electric motors and has more than 1,100 horsepower. Of course, Tesla Roadster is in the pipeline along with Tesla Semi. These models are likely for delivery in FY2022 or FY2023. With Tesla Semi, the company will make its first move in the commercial EV segment. Overall, Tesla has a promising line-up and TSLA stock looks attractive after the recent correction. The EV industry is positioned for a multi-decade growth and Tesla is well positioned to benefit. XPeng (XPEV) Source: Andy Feng / Shutterstock.com XPEV stock has been sideways to lower in the last two months. With strong growth likely through the year, the stock is attractive at recent levels around $35. For Q3 2020, the company reported vehicle deliveries of 8,578, which was higher by 265.8% on a year-on-year basis. Further, for Q4 2020, the company guided for more than 10,000 vehicle deliveries. Strong growth is a key factor to be bullish on XPEV stock. Specific to new vehicle development, I see the following growth triggers. First, the company selected Livox, which is a leading manufacturer of lidar equipment. Xpeng will be the first EV company to deploy “automotive-grade lidar technology” in the current year of production. Second, the company’s third model is slated for launch this year with mass production toward the end of the year. The launch of this sedan model is another growth trigger for the company. It’s worth noting that the G3 and P7 have already been delivering robust sales numbers. In addition, XPeng launched the G3 smart electric SUV in Norway. The current year is likely to be a year for further expansion in Europe. 8 Stocks to Buy for March XPeng is scheduled to report Q4 2020 results on March 8. It’s very likely that the company’s numbers will exceed analyst estimates. That’s another potential trigger for renewed rally. CIIG Merger (CIIC) Source: NESPIX / Shutterstock.com In November 2020, CIIG Merger announced a business combination plan with Arrival. The latter is in the manufacturing of commercial electric vehicles and has ambitious plans for the next few years. I believe that CIIC stock is among the top electric vehicle stocks to consider for the year. Arrival is planning to commence electric bus production in the fourth quarter of 2021. The company is in advanced discussions for orders and deliveries are likely toward the end of the year. Furthermore, Arrival expects to begin production of electric vans and large electric vans in FY2022. For this, the company already has an initial order of 10,000 vans from United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). Therefore, starting with the current year, the company has a good product pipeline. It’s important to note that the SPAC business combination ensures that the company has $660 million in gross cash proceeds. One differentiating factor for Arrival is micro-factories. These factories require a lower capital expenditure and can be constructed in six months. In the next two years, the company plans for micro-factories in the U.S. and European Union. Hyundai (OTCMKTS:HYMTF) and Kia Motors are among the investors in the company. The strategic investment and partnership will enable joint development of vehicles using Arrival’s platform. The partnership underscores the company’s credibility and can be a long-term growth catalyst. Overall, CIIC stock has been in a range of consolidation below $30. With the business combination likely to close toward the end of Q1 2021, CIIC stock is worth considering. Electric Vehicle Stocks: Churchill Capital (CCIV) Source: Pasuwan/ShutterStock.com As I write, CCIV stock is lower by 33% in pre-market. The sharp correction comes after Lucid Motors confirmed the business combination plan with Churchill Capital. I did warn in one of my recent articles that CCIV stock will “sell-off” on news. However, I would keep the stock on the radar to accumulate on dips. Lucid Motors has some big plans for the year. In December 2020, the company completed construction of its first factory with an initial production capacity of 30,000 vehicles. With phased expansion, capacity is likely to ramp up to 40,000 vehicles. The company intends to begin production and deliveries of Lucid Air Dream Editions in Spring. Lucid Air Pure will be up for production in FY2022. In anticipation of the launch, Lucid Motors is also establishing 20 Lucid Studios through the United States. The initial model will be showcased to consumers through these studios. Lucid Motors has guided for revenue of $2.2 billion for FY2022. The company says revenue is likely to surge to $22 billion by FY2026. Besides Lucid Air, the company’s top-line growth is likely to be fueled by new models in FY2023 and FY2025. 8 Stocks to Buy for March With ambitious growth plans, CCIV stock is attractive for the long term. Niu Technologies (NIU) Source: Shutterstock Among electric vehicle stocks, NIU stock has been relatively unnoticed. The stock has, however, moved higher by 355% in the last year. Niu Technologies is a provider of smart electric two-wheeled vehicles. For FY2020, the company sold 600,892 e-scooters, which was higher by 42.6% year-over-year. With sales in 46 countries, the company is positioned for sustained growth. Entry to new markets will continue to trigger growth. As an example, Niu Technologies is eying entry to India, which has a big addressable and under-penetrated EV market. Further, the company has new products set for the year. One of the products is the RQi electric motorcycle. According to the company, “RQi can achieve a top speed of 160 km/h and can return up to 130 km of range in a single charge.” Additionally, TQi, which is a self-balancing three-wheeler, will be launched in the second half of the year. EUB-01, an electric bicycle, is another product likely to be launched in FY2021. Therefore, with an exciting product pipeline, Niu Technologies is positioned for sales volume and top-line growth. I would expect NIU stock to continue trending higher after some consolidation. Electrameccanica Vehicles (SOLO) Source: Luis War / Shutterstock.com SOLO stock, which recently was trading around $6, is another interesting name among electric vehicle stocks. The stock trades at a market capitalization of just $568 million. Electrameccanica is manufacturing a single-seat electric vehicle called SOLO. The soft launch of SOLO is underway in the United States. As of February 2020, the company had 20 retail locations for marketing and sale of the Solo EV. In the coming years, the company plans expansion outside the United States. An attractive factor about Solo EV is the pricing. With a true cost of ownership of $20,283, the electric vehicle is likely to attract attention from consumers. I also like the fact that Electrameccanica is pursuing an asset-light model. For manufacturing, the company has a strategic partnership with Zongshen Industrial Group. 8 Stocks to Buy for March Depending on the demand for the company’s EV, a manufacturing or assembling facility is likely in the coming years. Overall, SOLO stock is attractive after a sharp correction. The EV industry has multi-year tailwinds and the company has a differentiating factor. Electric Vehicle Stocks: NextGen Acquisition (NGAC) Source: Shutterstock In another recent business combination, truck maker Xos will go public through a $2 billion SPAC deal with NextGen Acquisition. NGAC stock surged higher on this news. As an overview, Xos is another player in the commercial EV segment. The company’s full suite of Class 5 to Class 8 electric vehicles are expected to be launched in the current year and FY2022. The company expects to deliver 116 EVs in the year. The delivery of EVs is likely to increase to 33,674 by FY2025. It’s worth noting that Xos has an order backlog of 6,000 commercial EVs. This includes orders from clients United Parcel Service, Loomis, UniFirst and others. I expect the order backlog to swell as companies shift toward electric vehicles. Similar to Arrival, the company is also working on flex manufacturing, which involves a $45 million capital expenditure per facility. These facilities can be constructed in a year. Once these factories operate at full utilization, EBITDA margin can be robust. With the deal just being announced, the business combination is at least two quarters away. However, NGAC stock will be attractive for exposure on correction. In addition, if the company announces further additions to the order backlog, the stock can move higher.

            "Date": "2021-02-26",
            "Headline": "Better Buy: MercadoLibre vs. Alibaba",
            "Text": "MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are two of the world's largest e-commerce companies. MercadoLibre, founded in Argentina in 1999, is Latin America's leading e-commerce player with a presence in 18 countries. Alibaba launched the same year and has become China's top e-commerce and cloud services company.\n\nBoth companies have generated significant returns for their early investors. MercadoLibre went public at $18 per share in 2007, and the stock currently trades for nearly $1,700. Alibaba made its market debut at $68 in 2014, and shares trade at over $240 as of this writing.\n\nMercadoLibre stock surged almost 150% over the past 12 months as the pandemic caused more people to shop online. Meanwhile, Alibaba stock advanced less than 20% during the same period as ongoing regulatory concerns kept many investors away. But past performance never guarantees future gains, so let's take a fresh look at both e-commerce giants to see which is the better buy.\n\nThe differences between MercadoLibre and Alibaba\n\nMercadoLibre splits its operation into two main segments: its commerce business, which earns commissions and shipping fees from sellers, and its fintech business, which includes its payment service Mercado Pago and its credit system Mercado Credito.\n\nThe company generated 64% of its revenue from its commerce business in the first nine months of 2020 with the rest coming from its fintech services. It isn't consistently profitable, but it stayed in the black through much of 2020 as its explosive revenue growth outpaced rising operating expenses.\n\nAlibaba splits its business into four main segments: the core commerce unit, which covers its online and brick-and-mortar stores; Alibaba Cloud, its cloud infrastructure platform; the digital media and entertainment unit, which includes its streaming media and online gaming businesses; and the innovation initiatives segment, which houses its other non-core businesses.\n\nThough there are four reporting segments, Alibaba generated 87% of its revenue and the entirety of its profits from its core commerce business in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 (which ends March 31). The company is consistently profitable, but it continually subsidizes the growth of its unprofitable ventures with its core commerce segment.\n\nWhich e-commerce giant is growing faster?\n\nMercadoLibre's revenue rose 63% year over year to $2.65 billion in the first nine months of 2020. It generated nearly 95% of its revenue from Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico, and ended the third quarter with 76.1 million unique active users, up 92%.\n\nDuring the third quarter, its GMV (gross merchandise volume), or the value of all products sold on its marketplaces, surged 62% year over year (117% in constant currency). As for the fintech segment, Mercado Pago's TPV (total payment volume) also soared an impressive 92% to $14.5 billion (161% in constant currency).\n\nManagement attributed that growth to an accelerated shift toward online shopping throughout the pandemic. On the bottom line, net profits of $49.9 million in the first nine months of 2020 were a complete reversal of the $118.0 million loss reported in the year-ago period. Robust revenue growth and tighter spending measures offset higher shipping costs and slimmer product margins last year.\n\nTurning to its counterpart in the Chinese market, Alibaba grew revenue 34% year over year to 529.9 billion yuan ($81.2 billion) in the first nine months of fiscal 2021. Core commerce revenue rose 34%, but its margins are contracting as the company relies more on lower-margin businesses (including its brick-and-mortar stores, cross-border marketplace, direct sales, and logistics unit) to drive its top-line growth.\n\nTotal margins remain stable for now, and non-GAAP net income still rose 32% to 145.8 billion yuan ($22.3 billion) over the same period. But looking ahead, Alibaba could face mounting pressure to narrow the losses at its three unprofitable businesses as its core commerce profitability declines.\n\nAlibaba also faces an ongoing antitrust probe in China, which could force it to eliminate its exclusive deals with merchants and aggressive pricing strategies for new users. Those headwinds, along with intense domestic competition and tighter auditing requirements for Chinese stocks in the U.S., likely held Alibaba stock back as other e-commerce stocks soared over the past year.\n\nThe winner: MercadoLibre\n\nAnalysts expect MercadoLibre to end 2020 with 68% top-line growth, and that number will slow to 42% for the current year. Profits will continue rising too, but the stock still looks pricey at 570 times forward earnings and 15 times 2021 sales, even though it may be cheaper relative to other high-growth tech stocks.\n\nAlibaba is not far behind with consensus estimates for 51% and 31% revenue growth in fiscal 2021 and 2022, respectively. Earnings should also continue rising at a double-digit rate. Those are impressive numbers for a stock that trades at just 20 times forward earnings and less than five times sales, but its regulatory hurdles could still cause it to miss those rosy expectations and result in other challenges for the company long term.\n\nMercadoLibre ultimately has more room to expand in Latin America, which is less saturated by online marketplaces than China, and it faces fewer direct competitors and regulatory headwinds. It also won't suffer as much as Alibaba if trade tensions escalate between the U.S. and China again. That's why I personally own MercadoLibre rather than Alibaba, and investors are better off buying the former over the latter right now."

            "Date": "2021-02-27",
            "Headline": "2 Hyper-Growth Stocks to Buy in the Next Bear Market",
            "Text": "Last year was a roller-coaster ride for investors. After posting its fastest 30% drop ever, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) staged a stunning comeback, driven by a wave of stimulus-fueled liquidity and monetary easing.\n\nThis month, the stock market hit fresh record highs. But cracks in the facade are starting to show. Last week and part of this week, the S&P 500 dropped for five straight sessions -- its longest losing streak in a year.\n\nWe don't yet know if this is a brief pullback or the beginning of a big correction. What we do know, however, is that rallies never go uninterrupted. We also know the broader economy remains in shambles due to COVID-19.\n\nBut don't panic. Instead, get excited -- a bear market is a great time to buy great stocks -- including hyper-growth names like Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) and Pinduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD).\n\nWhy Sea Limited should be on your radar\n\nFor many companies, 2020 was a year to forget. But for Sea, it was a year to remember.\n\nThe pandemic supercharged demand for Sea's gaming, e-commerce, and digital finance businesses as socially distanced consumers adjusted to life in the new normal.\n\nIn the third quarter, the number of active users for Garena, Sea's gaming division, grew 78% year over year to a staggering 572 million. Shopee, Sea's e-commerce arm, experienced a 131% surge in gross orders to 742 million -- leading to a 103% jump in gross merchandise volume (GMV). Sea's digital finance business -- the smallest of its three segments -- also saw strong adoption, with paying users surpassing 17.8 million. As a result, revenue almost doubled to $1.2 billion.\n\nAnd Sea's just getting started. As the company expands across Southeast Asia and Latin America, investors can expect it to keep up its impressive momentum. In that regard, Sea has plenty of growth levers to pull. For one, it could further monetize its gaming and e-commerce businesses. Its e-commerce business also has a long growth runway, given Southeast Asia's low levels of e-commerce penetration. Analysts expect Sea's revenue to grow by 78% in 2021 and 46% in 2022.\n\nIt should be no surprise, then, that Sea trades at almost 40 times trailing 12-month revenue. But before you take the plunge, consider this: Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) -- the world's biggest e-commerce company -- trades at 4.2 times sales.\n\nOver the long term (five to 10 years), Sea looks poised to trounce Amazon's returns. But given the premium the shares carry currently, it would be prudent to wait for a pullback before buying in.\n\nPinduoduo has posted impressive gains\n\nI'm an avid fan of e-commerce platform operators like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). Operating in winner-take-most markets, these businesses have generated impressive gains for their shareholders.\n\nBut Pinduoduo is trumping them all. Despite being a relative newcomer -- it came into existence only in 2015 -- its GMV has grown to 1.5 trillion yuan ($215 billion) in the last 12 months. That's almost half of Amazon's 2020 GMV of $475 billion.\n\nIn fact, Pinduoduo has already overtaken JD.com to become China's second-biggest e-commerce platform. In the third quarter, it reported 731 million active buyers (customers who made at least one purchase in the last 12 months). In the next few quarters, I think Pinduoduo will report more active buyers than Alibaba.\n\nIts revenue grew 44% during the quarter when China first imposed statewide lockdowns, demonstrating that the company can handle external shocks. But Pinduoduo didn't just survive COVID-19, it delivered blowout growth -- a testament to its extremely scalable business model. In the third quarter, revenue surged 89% to $2.1 billion. On top of that, Pinduoduo reported $69 million in non-GAAP profit -- its first net profit ever. That's no small feat for a company that had zero revenue in 2015.\n\nDespite its spectacular rise, Pinduoduo's best days are yet ahead. The company boasts a fast-growing platform almost as large as Taobao and Tmall, the marketplaces that Alibaba owns. Yet Pinduoduo's annual revenue is just a fraction of Alibaba's $14 billion in China-based e-commerce revenue for the same period. That leaves Pinduoduo with lots of room to grow.\n\nTo capture this opportunity, it is entering new shopping categories, and also expanding its agriculture business. It could even launch ancillary ventures in areas such as logistics and payments -- which is what Alibaba has done with Alipay and Cainiao, among other businesses.\n\nPinduoduo has truly exciting growth prospects -- which could explain why the stock trades at a whopping 36 times trailing 12-month revenue. For perspective, Alibaba trades at a fourth of that multiple.\n\nLike Sea Limited, Pinduoduo's a great growth stock. But both companies trade at pricey valuations now. It would make much more sense to buy into them at discounts to their current levels -- and the chance to do that may appear if a bear market does."

            "Date": "2021-02-27",
            "Headline": "Better Buy: Amazon vs. Alibaba",
            "Text": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are the world's two biggest e-commerce companies and, in many ways, the companies are mirror images of one another.\n\nIn addition to operating the world's leading e-commerce marketplaces, both companies have large cloud infrastructure business, logistics operations, and exposure to digital entertainment through video streaming, among other satellite businesses.\n\nThese are giant companies, but they've managed to maintain strong top-line growth rates, and their stocks have outperformed the market in recent years, as the chart below shows.\n\nIn this battle between two global tech giants, which is the better buy today? Let's take a look at what each stock has to offer today in order to answer that question.\n\nAmazon in peak form\n\nFew companies have ended up benefitting from the economic effects caused by the coronavirus pandemic as much as Amazon. Amazon revenue jumped more than $100 billion last year. That increase is more than what only a handful of U.S. companies normally generate in revenue annually. Nearly all of its businesses, including video streaming, cloud computing, and voice-activated technology, have gotten some kind of tailwind from the crisis, but its e-commerce business has really shined over the last year.\n\nNorth American e-commerce sales jumped 38% in the year to $170.8 billion as the company became a lifeline for consumers during the pandemic. International e-commerce sales surged 40% to $104.4 billion, and it flipped from a $1.7 billion operating loss into a $717 million operating income.\n\nAmazon's competitive advantages are manifest as its Prime loyalty program locks in customers, and it has layered on high-margin services to its e-commerce business like its third-party marketplace, fulfillment, and advertising. As those segments and its cloud business have taken off, profits have soared. Net income nearly doubled last year to $21.3 billion even as the company absorbed billions in COVID-19-related costs.\n\nAmazon is at a turning point with CEO Jeff Bezos set to step down in the third quarter, but the company's many competitive advantages won't be easily undone. Profit margins should continue to ramp up as the company approaches $500 billion in annual revenue.\n\nAlibaba: The best of growth and value\n\nAlibaba shares were rocked in recent months by rumors that founder Jack Ma was \"missing\" and after Chinese officials announced an antitrust investigation into the company. Those events underscore some of the risks facing Chinese stocks like Alibaba, but the stock's recovery once Ma made a public appearance is a reminder that those risks are often exaggerated.\n\nLike Amazon, Alibaba has put up strong growth during the pandemic even as China rebounded much faster than the U.S. from the crisis. The company's revenue jumped 37% in its most recent quarter to $33.9 billion and it finished the year with 779 million active annual consumers, showing the value of operating in a massive market like China.\n\nBecause its core business is an e-commerce marketplace, Alibaba is also highly profitable, collecting commissions on sales on its marketplaces like TMall and Taobao. Over the last year, it passed $1 trillion in gross merchandise volume (GMV), making it the biggest online marketplace by GMV in the world. In its most recent quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 22% to $10.5 billion, giving it a 31% adjusted EBITDA margin. Alibaba's other businesses like cloud and logistics saw revenue growth of 50% or better in the recent quarter, and the company is also continually expanding through partnerships with businesses like Farfetch and Dufry, leveraging other companies' assets and increasing its competitive advantages. Alibaba is an attractive partner for almost any brand looking to do business in China.\n\nAlibaba's base in China also sets it up for strong growth. China has become the world's biggest retail market, and consumer spending will continue to grow as more Chinese move into cities and join the middle class, paving the way for long-term growth.\n\nAmazon and Alibaba: Head-to-head\n\nBoth Amazon and Alibaba have similar businesses and enjoy competitive advantage through network effects and their leading positions in e-commerce in their respective geographies.\n\nThe major difference between the two stocks comes down to valuation. Amazon trades at a price-to-earnings valuation of 75, while Alibaba is valued at just 26, making it nearly three times as cheap as Amazon. Given the risks in China, including the vagaries of the ruling communist party, Chinese stocks tend to trade at a discount to their American counterparts. However, Amazon also faces a similar set of risks as antitrust investigations have mounted against the company and other FAANG stocks.\n\nConsidering the significant valuation gap between the two stocks, Alibaba is the better buy today. While both of these stocks look poised to outperform the S&P 500 over the coming years based on their competitive advantages and growth momentum, Alibaba is the better value of the two. Its lower price tag gives investors assurance that even if growth stocks fall -- a distinct possibility in the economic reopening -- Alibaba shares will remain solid."
